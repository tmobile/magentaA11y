          "developerNotes": "## Our General Advice\n\nThink carefully before you use a carousel, slideshow, or multi-slide component. Consider another way to present the information.\n\n### Carousels go against many usability and accessibility best practices\n\nWherever possible, do not use carousels. Consider whether you can present content in another way, such as a list.\n\nCarousels are complex components that are hard to make accessible, and by their nature, go against many usability and accessibility best practices, such as:\n\n* Auto-advancing carousels are never allowed as it will violate [WCAG 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html). Additionally, auto-advancing can be incredibly distracting for many users, and can be disruptive for screen reader users.\n* Carousels are a visual-first design that is complex to relay to screen readers the proper structure and information architecture.\n* Studies have shown that most people do not interact with carousels, or advance any slides. (Source: [Norman Nielsen article](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/designing-effective-carousels/))\n\n### Alternatives to Carousels\n\nSome alternative components to a Carousel to consider are:\n\n* A multi-step form\n  * This can work because it helps people stay on task.\n* A list of easily recognizable structure, like \"US Presidents\"\n  * This can work because the scope and contents are predictable.\n* Highlighted customer reviews\n  * This can work to build trust because the contents are predictable and a motivated user seeking social proof may be willing to navigate the carousel.\n\n## Code examples\n\n### Use semantic HTML\n\nThis is one example of an accessible carousel that uses HTML semantics and ARIA:\n\n* The carousel is grouped and has a name\n* The ordered list structure provides context for how many slides and which number slide someone is on.\n* No focus management is happening. We have chosen to NOT move a user from the next/previous buttons and allow them to browse at their own pace.\n* This example does not make use of a live announcing region, but in some cases, that may be helpful.\n\n```html\n<h2 id=\"headingCarousel\">Phones available</h2>\r\n<section id=\"carousel\" aria-label=\"Carousel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingCarousel carousel\" class=\"carousel\">\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"flex\">\r\n      <div>\r\n         <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary button-control button-control--left\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\">&lt;&lt;</span>\r\n            <span class=\"hidden-visually\">Previous 3 slides</span>\r\n         </button>\r\n         <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary button-control button-control--right\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\">&gt;&gt;</span>\r\n            <span class=\"hidden-visually\">Next 3 slides</span>\r\n         </button>\r\n      </div>\r\n    <ol class=\"list\" role=\"list\"> \r\n<!--  Need role=\"list\" because of weird Voiceover bug: https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/01/12/lists-and-safari.html      -->\r\n      <li><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591337676887-a217a6970a8a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTR8fGlwaG9uZXxlbnwwfHwwfHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=60\" alt=\"iPhone 14\" /></li>\r\n      <li><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583574333311-3a86605c76b2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2068&q=80\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy phone\" /></li>\r\n      <li><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1612442443556-09b5b309e637?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1740&q=80\" alt=\"Google Pixel phone\" /></li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n  </div>\r\n</section>\n```\n\n<example>\r\n   <h2 id=\"headingCarousel\">Phones available</h2>\r\n   <section id=\"carousel\" aria-label=\"Carousel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingCarousel carousel\" class=\"carousel\">\r\n      <div class=\"flex\">\r\n         <div class=\"button-container\">\r\n            <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary button-control button-control--left\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\">&lt;&lt;</span>\r\n               <span class=\"hidden-visually\">Previous 3 slides</span>\r\n            </button>\r\n            <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary button-control button-control--right\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\">&gt;&gt;</span>\r\n               <span class=\"hidden-visually\">Next 3 slides</span>\r\n            </button>\r\n         </div>\r\n         <ol class=\"list\" role=\"list\"> \r\n      <!--  Need role=\"list\" because of weird Voiceover bug: https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/01/12/lists-and-safari.html      -->\r\n            <li><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591337676887-a217a6970a8a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTR8fGlwaG9uZXxlbnwwfHwwfHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=60\" alt=\"iPhone 14\" /></li>\r\n            <li><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583574333311-3a86605c76b2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2068&q=80\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy phone\" /></li>\r\n            <li><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1612442443556-09b5b309e637?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1740&q=80\" alt=\"Google Pixel phone\" /></li>\r\n         </ol>\r\n      </div>\r\n   </section>\r\n</example>\n\n## Related WCAG\n\n* [WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships)\n* [WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard.html)\n* [WCAG 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html)\n* [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value)"

          "developerNotes": "## Code examples\n\n### Use semantic HTML\n\n* This semantic HTML contains all accessibility features by default.\n* It uses [CSS pseudo attributes](https://github.com/tmobile/magentaA11y/blob/main/_sass/modules/_input-checkbox.scss) to create the checkbox indicator, without Javascript.\n\n```html\n<fieldset>\r\n  <legend>Choose your favorite Sesame Street characters:</legend>\r\n\r\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"elmoCheckbox\">\r\n  <label for=\"elmoCheckbox\">Elmo</label>\r\n\r\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"bigBirdCheckbox\">\r\n  <label for=\"bigBirdCheckbox\">Big Bird</label>\r\n\r\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cookieCheckbox\" checked>\r\n  <label for=\"cookieCheckbox\">Cookie Monster</label>\r\n</fieldset>\n```\n\n<example>\r\n<fieldset>\r\n  <legend>Choose your favorite Sesame Street characters:</legend>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"elmoCheckbox\">\r\n  <label for=\"elmoCheckbox\">Elmo</label>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"bigBirdCheckbox\">\r\n  <label for=\"bigBirdCheckbox\">Big Bird</label>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cookieCheckbox\" checked>\r\n  <label for=\"cookieCheckbox\">Cookie Monster</label>\r\n</fieldset>\r\n</example>\n\n### Don't put interactive elements inside the label\n\nEven though this is valid HTML, it creates unpredictable results with screenreaders. A (currently) reliable method is to keep interactive elements outside the label and reference it with `aria-describedby=\"hint-id\"`\n\n```html\n<fieldset>\r\n  <legend>Legal disclaimers</legend>\r\n  <div id=\"hint-tc\" class=\"hint-checkbox\">\r\n    <a href=\"/code-of-conduct/\">Read terms and conditions</a>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <input type=\"checkbox\"\r\n         id=\"tc-agree\"\r\n         aria-describedby=\"hint-tc\">\r\n  <label for=\"tc-agree\">\r\n    I agree to the terms and conditions\r\n  </label>\r\n</fieldset>\n```\n\n<example>\r\n<fieldset>\r\n  <legend>Legal

focusable checkbox (preferred)\n\n* An input using `aria-disabled=\"true` will be focusable with the tab key\n* Use JS to `preventDefault()`\n\n```html\n<fieldset>\r\n  <legend>Choose your favorite fruit</legend>\r\n\r\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"lemonsCheckbox\" aria-disabled=\"true\" checked>\r\n  <label for=\"lemonsCheckbox\">Lemons</label>\r\n\r\n  <input type=\"checkbox\"

<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"lemonsCheckbox\" aria-disabled=\"true\" checked>\r\n  <label for=\"lemonsCheckbox\">Lemons</label>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"limesCheckbox\" aria-disabled=\"true\">\r\n  <label for=\"limesCheckbox\">Limes</label>\n\n</fieldset>\r\n</example>\n\n### Fully disabled checkbox\n\n* An input using the `disabled` attribute will not be focusable with the tab key\n* Arrow keys will still be able to browse disabled inputs\n\n```html\n<fieldset>\r\n  <legend>Choose your favorite video game</legend>\r\n\r\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"marioCheckbox\" disabled checked>\r\n  <label for=\"marioCheckbox\">MarioKart</label>\r\n\r\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zeldaCheckbox\" disabled>\r\n  <label for=\"zeldaCheckbox\">Legend of

for=\"marioCheckbox\">MarioKart</label>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zeldaCheckbox\" disabled>\r\n  <label for=\"zeldaCheckbox\">Legend of Zelda</label>\n\n</fieldset>\r\n</example>\n\n### When you can't use semantic HTML\n\nThis custom checkbox requires extra attributes and event listeners:\n\n```html\n<div role=\"checkbox\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-checked=\"true\">\r\n  Elmo\r\n</div>\n```\n\n### Speciality checkboxes\n\nSometimes a design may call for a card-type checkbox.\n\n* Its core should still be a semantic checkbox input\n* Use `aria-describedby` to read extra content *after* the the name, role, and state\n\n```html\n<ul class=\"cards\">\r\n  <li class=\"card interactive\">\r\n    <input type=\"checkbox\"\r\n           id=\"oscarCheckboxCard\"\r\n           aria-describedby=\"descriptionOscar\" >\r\n    <label for=\"oscarCheckboxCard\">\r\n      Oscar the Grouch\r\n    </label>\r\n    <div class=\"extended-description\"\r\n

checkbox input\n* Use `aria-describedby=\"hint-id\"` for hints or additional descriptions\n* `aria-label=\"Checkbox input purpose\"` can also be used (as a last resort)\n\n### Role\n\n* **By default**, semantic HTML checkbox inputs identify as a checkbox\n* Use `role=\"checkbox\"` for custom elements\n\n### Group\n\n* Semantic HTML\n  * `<fieldset>` wraps a checkbox group\n  * `<legend>` describes the group's purpose\n  * Each `<label>` must include `for=\"input-id\"` to be associated with its input\n* Custom elements\n  * Use `role=\"group\"` in the place of fieldset\n  * Use `aria-labelledby=\"label-id\"` to associate an element as a label\n  * `aria-label=\"Group purpose\"` can also be used if there's no label with an `id`\n\n### State\n\n* Semantic HTML\n  * Use `checked` for native HTML\n  * Use the `disabled` state for inactive checkboxes\n* Custom element\n  * Use `aria-checked=\"true/false\"` to express state\n  * Use `aria-disabled=\"true\"` to declare inactive elements\n\n### Focus\n\n* Focus must be visible\n* Custom elements will require keyboard event listeners"

These types of images are generally included for purely stylistic purposes and don't impart any meaning to the rest of the content on the page.\n\n## Is this image decorative or informative?\n\nIf the image conveys important meaning, and there's no other text on the page which explains the concept within it, then the image is likely informative. In this case, check out the [informative image checklist](/checklist-web/image) item instead.\n\n## Decorative images still require an alt attribute\n\n* To have valid HTML, the `alt` attribute must still be present, even when set to the empty empty value of `alt`. Note that `alt` and `alt=\"\"` (no space) are equivalent in HTML.\n  * When the `alt` attribute is empty, the screen reader ignores it (and will not read anything).\n  * When the `alt` attribute is missing, the screen reader will read the `src` name or filename of the image which is a very poor user experience.\n\n<example class=\"example example--contains-icon\">\r\n  <h3 class=\"h-charlie decorated\">\r\n    <img src=\"media/images/icons/icon-info.svg\" alt=\"\"> \r\n    Note: Your plan might be changing soon.\r\n  </h3>\r\n  <a href=\"tel:8888888888\" className=\"decorated\">\r\n    <img src=\"media/images/icons/icon-phone.svg\" class=\"icon\" alt=\"\">\r\n      Call us: 888-888-8888\r\n  </a>\r\n</example>\n\n```html\n<h3 class=\"h-charlie decorated\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=\"media/images/icons/icon-info.svg\"\r\n    class=\"icon\"\r\n    alt=\"\" />\r\n  Note: Your plan might be changing soon.\r\n</h3>\r\n<a \r\n  href=\"tel:8888888888\"\r\n  class=\"decorated\">\r\n  <img \r\n    src=\"media/images/icons/icon-phone.svg\"\r\n    class=\"icon\"\r\n    alt=\"\" />\r\n    Call us: 888-888-8888\r\n</a>\n```\n\n## Using inline SVG\n\n### Inline SVG that is decorative\n\nInline SVGs require some special code to be hidden properly from screen readers:\n\n* `aria-hidden=\"true\"`\n\nIf you are using a `<use />` element, add `aria-hidden=\"true\"`.\n\n```html\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\">\r\n  <use href=\"#svg-id\" aria-hidden=\"true\" />\r\n  <!-- if not using <use> then the child elements \r\n       of the inline SVG would go here -->\r\n</svg>\n```\n\n## Further reading\n\n* This page owes a lot to this exhaustive blog post: [Contextually Marking up accessible images and SVGs by Scott O'Hara](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/05/22/contextual-images-svgs-and-a11y.html)\n* [W3C Image decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/)"

however it does leave additional elements in the DOM which is unnecessary.\n\n```html\n<label for=\"favorite-snack\">\r\n  What is your favorite snack?\r\n</label>\r\n<input type=\"text\"\r\n       id=\"favorite-snack\"\r\n       aria-describedby=\"hint-favorite-snack\">\r\n<div class=\"hint\" id=\"hint-favorite-snack\">\r\n  <!-- Leave the hint element empty -->\r\n</div>\n```\n\n## Developer notes\n\n### Browser + screenreader quirks\n\n* Screenreaders do not implement alerts uniformly and must be tested.\n  * Just because an alert pattern works in one screenreader doesn't mean it will work in all three screenreaders.\n* The element referenced by the `aria-describedby` attribute cannot use the `role=\"alert\"` attribute (see example above for workaround).\n  * [VoiceOver fails to read a referenced `role=\"alert\"` element when the input is in focus](https://a11ysupport.io/tests/tech__aria__aria-describedby-with-role-alert).\n* NVDA will read the alert twice if it appears while the input is in focus: once from the `role=\"alert\"` being injected and again from the `aria-describedby` association.\n* NVDA needs a fraction of a second to catch up with changes in the DOM, use a `setTimeout` to delay displaying the alert."

This attribute has very low and support and unpredictable output across screen readers.\n\n## Name\n\n* The modal window has a logical descriptive name from either:\n  * `aria-label=\"Modal title\"` or\n  * `aria-labelledby=\"heading-id\"` pointing to an `<h2>` as a title\n\n### Role\n\n* Use `role=\"dialog\"` so the screen reader can identify this as a dialog or modal.\n\n### Group\n\n* Upon closing, focus must return to the button that launched the dialog.\n\n### State\n\n* Use `aria-modal=\"true\"` to indicate content beneath the modal is inert and that the screen reader must not browse outside the dialog.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use `tabindex=\"-1\"` to make the modal itself targetable for focus.\n* Upon closing, focus must return to the button that launched the dialog.\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [Browser Support](https://caniuse.com/?search=dialog)\n\n## Screenreader differences\n\n### NVDA\n\n* By default, NVDA may read the entire modal upon launch. This is expected behavior.\n\n## Code examples\n\n### Use semantic HTML where possible\n\nSince browser support for `<dialog>` is incomplete, if you plan to use the `<dialog>` element we recommend that you include the `role=\"dialog\"` attribute because the element alone is not fully compatible.\n\nSome browsers require additional scripting. This simple example works in Chrome, but [may not work correctly in all browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=dialog) such as Safari and Firefox.\n\n```html\n   <button data-fn=\"showModal\" \r\n         data-target=\"dialog-example-modal\" \r\n         id=\"showModal\">\r\n   Things you should know\r\n   </button>\r\n\r\n   <dialog role=\"dialog\"\r\n         id=\"dialog-example-modal\"\r\n         class=\"dialog\"\r\n         tabindex=\"-1\"\r\n         aria-modal=\"true\"\r\n         aria-labelledby=\"dialog-title\">\r\n   <button aria-label=\"close\" \r\n         type=\"button\" \r\n         data-fn=\"closeModal\" \r\n         id=\"closeModal\" \r\n         class=\"close\">\r\n   </button>\r\n   <div class=\"dialog__content\">\r\n      <h2 id=\"dialog-title\" class=\"h-bravo\">\r\n         Things you should know\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <h3>Keyboard</h3>\r\n      <ul>\r\n         <li>Focus must not enter the rest of the page.</li>\r\n         <li>The escape key must close the modal.</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <h3>Screenreader</h3>\r\n      <ul>\r\n         <li>The modal's title is announced on launch.</li>\r\n         <li>The screen reader cannot read content behind the dialog.</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <button type=\"submit\">\r\n         Continue\r\n      </button>\r\n   </section>\r\n   </dialog>\n```\n\n<example>\r\n   <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary\" data-fn=\"showModal\" data-target=\"dialog-example-modal\" id=\"showModal\">\r\n   Things you should know\r\n   </button>\n\n   <dialog role=\"dialog\"\r\n         id=\"dialog-example-modal\"\r\n         class=\"dialog\"\r\n         tabindex=\"-1\"\r\n         aria-modal=\"true\"\r\n         aria-labelledby=\"dialog-title\">\r\n         <div class=\"dialog__content\">\r\n   <button aria-label=\"close\" type=\"button\" data-fn=\"closeModal\" id=\"closeModal\" class=\"close\">\r\n   </button>\r\n   <div class=\"dialog-content\">\r\n      <h2 id=\"dialog-title\" class=\"h-bravo\">\r\n         Things you should know\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <h3>Keyboard</h3>\r\n      <ul>\r\n         <li>Focus must not enter the rest of the page.</li>\r\n         <li>The escape key must close the modal.</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <h3>Screenreader</h3>\r\n      <ul>\r\n         <li>The modal's title is announced on launch.</li>\r\n         <li>The screen reader cannot read content behind the dialog.</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary\" type=\"submit\" data-fn=\"closeModal\">\r\n         Continue\r\n      </button>\r\n   </div>\r\n   </dialog>\r\n</example> \n\n## Further Reading\n\n* [WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html)\n* [WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard)\n* [WCAG 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-order.html)\n* [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value)"

For example, “Password is currently visible”.\n  * Avoid adding `aria-hidden=\"true\"` or CSS `display: none;` to the live region container that receives the dynamic update as this may impact screen reader support.\n  * Ensure the dynamic text, that is added to the live region, is removed from the DOM after a short amount of time so screen reader users do not encounter this text while navigating beyond the form field.\n\n```html\n<form class=\"password-container button-variant\" data-show-password=\"false\" onsubmit=\"return false;\">\r\n    <label for=\"password-b\">\r\n      Password\r\n

It's recommended to add full ARIA attributes, even when using a `<progress>` element.\n\n### Use semantic HTML\n\n* This semantic HTML contains all accessibility features by default.\n* While not a requirement, it is focusable to increase discoverability.\n\n```html\n<progress role=\"progressbar\"\r\n          id=\"progress\"\r\n          tabindex=\"0\"\r\n          class=\"progress\"\r\n          aria-label=\"File upload\"\r\n          value=\"50\"\r\n          aria-valuemin=\"0\"\r\n          aria-valuenow=\"50\"\r\n          aria-valuemax=\"100\"\r\n          max=\"100\">\n```\n\n<example>\r\n<progress role=\"progressbar\"\r\n          id=\"progress\"\r\n          tabindex=\"0\"\r\n          class=\"progress\"\r\n          aria-label=\"File upload\"\r\n          value=\"50\"\r\n          aria-valuemin=\"0\"\r\n          aria-valuenow=\"50\"\r\n          aria-valuemax=\"100\"\r\n          max=\"100\">\r\n</example>\n\n### Spinner loading takeover\n\n* There are many variations of loaders and spinners.\n* While a takeover spinner modal is present, other content on the page must be inert.\n\n#### Use semantic HTML\n\n* This semantic HTML contains all accessibility features using a dialog.\n  * The `<progress>` element can be used to describe the state.\n\n#### Ensure content is ready before being available\n\n* If content is being loaded slowly behind the spinner inside an `aria-live` region, use `aria-busy=\"true\"` to keep it from being announced until the update is complete.\n\n```html\n<div id=\"really-slow-app\" \r\n     aria-live=\"polite\" \r\n     aria-busy=\"false\">\r\n     \r\n  <dialog role=\"dialog\"\r\n          class=\"dialog\"\r\n          id=\"spinner-modal\"\r\n          tabindex=\"-1\"\r\n          aria-modal=\"true\"\r\n          aria-label=\"progress spinner\">\r\n    <div class=\"dialog__content\">\r\n   <button aria-label=\"close\" type=\"button\" data-fn=\"closeModal\" id=\"closeModal\" class=\"close\"></button>\r\n      <div class=\"progress-spinner\">\r\n        <progress role=\"progressbar\" \r\n                  id=\"modal-title\" \r\n                  aria-label=\"Loading\"></progress>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </dialog>\r\n</div>\n```\n\n<example>\r\n  <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary\" data-fn=\"showModal\" id=\"showSpinnerModal\" data-target=\"spinner-modal\">\r\n    Launch spinner\r\n  </button>\n\n  <dialog role=\"dialog\"\r\n          class=\"dialog\"\r\n          id=\"spinner-modal\"\r\n          tabindex=\"-1\"\r\n          aria-modal=\"true\"\r\n          aria-label=\"progress spinner\">\r\n    <div class=\"dialog__content\">\r\n   <button aria-label=\"close\" type=\"button\" data-fn=\"closeModal\" id=\"closeModal\" class=\"close\"></button>\r\n      <div class=\"progress-spinner\">\r\n        <progress role=\"progressbar\" \r\n                  id=\"modal-title\" \r\n                  aria-label=\"Loading\"></progress>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </dialog>\r\n</div>\r\n</example>\n\n### Inline dynamic loading waiting example\n\nThis example dynamically injects progress updates that will be read by a screen reader:\n\n* `aria-busy=\"true\"` indicates that the region is busy\n* `aria-describedby` allows the current progress to be read when the button is focused\n* `aria-disabled` reinforces that the save action is incomplete\n* `role=\"status\"` has an implicit `aria-live=\"polite\"` and `aria-atomic=\"true\"`, meaning the entire content of the status will be read on each update\n\n```html\n<div id=\"slow-app\">\r\n   <span class=\"btn-with-chip\">\r\n      <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary\"\r\n

aria-disabled=\"false\">\r\n            Save\r\n      </button>\r\n      <span id=\"progress-chip\" \r\n         class=\"progress-chip\" \r\n         role=\"status\" \r\n         hidden>0%</span>\r\n   </span>\r\n</div>\n```\n\n<example>\r\n<div id=\"slow-app\">\r\n   <span class=\"btn-with-chip\">\r\n      <button\r\n      class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary\"\r\n

</custom-element>  \r\n</div>\n```\n\n## Specialty use cases\n\n### Radio mixed with interactive elements\n\n**Avoid** this pattern when possible! Radio groups are not supposed to consist of nested interactive elements. Radio button focus order is not what you may expect.\n\n* By default, it is not expected behavior that each radio button can be tabbed to. This is how radio buttons naturally behave\n\n* As soon as a radio button is selected, the selected radio input receives focus first from the group. As a result screen reader users may not discover a nested control for an option if they start switching between radio buttons alone\n\n* To try to mitigate screen reader users not discovering the nested controls, describe the fieldset / radiogroup with non-visual text. This can be done with <code>aria-describedby</code> on the <code>fieldset</code>. For example, \"Edit controls are available which follow each radio button\"\n\n* Ensure the nested controls also have additional context defined by <code>aria-describedby</code>. This will help screen reader users understand their purpose.\n\n* Use of the same <code>name</code> attribute is important to link the radio buttons as a programmatic group\n\n* Keyboard functionality such as arrow up/down/left/right should change the selected radio button.\n\n```html\n<fieldset class=\"checkbox-radio-group\" aria-describedby=\"styled-radio-group-helper-text\">\r\n  <legend>Choose your payment method:</legend>\r\n  <!-- Visually hidden helper text describing fieldset -->\r\n  <!-- This text should only be present in the DOM if the radio group has nested controls.

If the max character count is more than 20, consider use of a [text Input](/web-criteria/component/text-input/) field as this component will be cumbersome for people using a mouse.\n\n```html\n<div>\r\n  <label for=\"stepper\">\r\n    Quantity\r\n  </label>\r\n  <div class=\"stepper\">\r\n      <button class=\"button minus\" aria-label=\"Decrease Quantity\" aria-disabled=\"true\"></button>\r\n      <select id=\"stepper\"\r\n               name=\"stepper-input\"\r\n               min=\"1\"\r\n               max=\"11\"\r\n               data-selected=\"1\">\r\n         <option value=\"1\" selected>1</option>\r\n         <option value=\"2\">2</option>\r\n         <option value=\"3\">3</option>\r\n         <option value=\"4\">4</option>\r\n         <option value=\"5\">5</option>\r\n         <option value=\"6\">6</option>\r\n         <option value=\"7\">7</option>\r\n         <option value=\"8\">8</option>\r\n         <option value=\"9\">9</option>\r\n         <option value=\"10\">10</option>\r\n         <option value=\"11\">11</option>\r\n      </select>\r\n      <button class=\"button plus\" aria-label=\"Increase Quantity\"></button>\r\n   </div>\r\n  <!-- live container where \"Quantity updated, [number]\" will be dynamically updated -->\r\n  <div aria-live=\"polite\" class=\"hidden\" id=\"stepper-status-target\"></div>\r\n</div>\n```\n\n<!-- TODO disabling buttons -->\n\n<example>\r\n   <div>\r\n      <label for=\"stepper\">\r\n         Quantity\r\n      </label>\r\n      <div class=\"stepper\">\r\n            <button data-fn=\"decreaseSelectStepper\" data-icon=\"minus\" class=\"button minus\" aria-label=\"Decrease Quantity\" aria-disabled=\"true\"></button>\r\n            <select id=\"stepper\"\r\n                     name=\"stepper-input\"\r\n                     min=\"1\"\r\n                     max=\"11\"\r\n                     data-selected=\"1\">\r\n               <option value=\"1\" selected>1</option>\r\n               <option value=\"2\">2</option>\r\n               <option value=\"3\">3</option>\r\n               <option value=\"4\">4</option>\r\n               <option value=\"5\">5</option>\r\n               <option value=\"6\">6</option>\r\n               <option value=\"7\">7</option>\r\n               <option value=\"8\">8</option>\r\n               <option value=\"9\">9</option>\r\n               <option value=\"10\">10</option>\r\n               <option value=\"11\">11</option>\r\n            </select>\r\n            <button data-fn=\"increaseSelectStepper\" data-icon=\"plus\" class=\"button plus\" aria-label=\"Increase Quantity\"></button>\r\n         </div>\r\n      <!-- live container where \"Quantity updated, [number]\" will be dynamically updated -->\r\n      <div aria-live=\"polite\" class=\"hidden\" id=\"stepper-status-target-1\"></div>\r\n   </div>\r\n</example>\n\n### No-select stepper\n\n* Uses buttons to increment/decrement\n* Has an updating `aria-live` region to provide updates\n* Buttons should be disabled when the stepper hits its minimum or maximum value.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"stepper\">\r\n   <button id=\"decrement-button\" data-fn=\"decreaseNumber\" data-icon=\"minus\" class=\"button minus\" aria-label=\"Decrease Quantity\" aria-disabled=\"true\"></button>\r\n   <span id=\"step-number\">0</span>\r\n   <button data-icon=\"plus\"  data-fn=\"increaseNumber\" class=\"button plus\" aria-label=\"Increase Quantity\"></button>\r\n   <!-- live container where \"Quantity updated, [number]\" will be dynamically updated -->\r\n   <div aria-live=\"polite\" class=\"hidden\" id=\"stepper-status-target\"></div>\r\n</div>\n```\n\n<!-- TODO disabling buttons -->\n\n<example>\r\n   <div class=\"stepper\">\r\n      <button id=\"decrement-button\" data-fn=\"decreaseNumber\" data-icon=\"minus\" class=\"button minus\" aria-label=\"Decrease Quantity\" aria-disabled=\"true\"></button>\r\n      <span id=\"step-number\">0</span>\r\n      <button data-icon=\"plus\"  data-fn=\"increaseNumber\" class=\"button plus\" aria-label=\"Increase Quantity\"></button>\r\n      <!-- live container where \"Quantity updated, [number]\" will be dynamically updated -->\r\n      <div aria-live=\"polite\" class=\"hidden\" id=\"stepper-status-target\"></div>\r\n   </div>\r\n</example>\n\n## Developer notes\n\n* This stepper example provides both `button` and `select` elements for users to change a value.\n\n* A non-visual live container with `aria-live=\"polite\"` is present in the DOM on page load. When the `button` element is activated, this non-visual live container is updated with dynamic content that screen reader users will hear announced as they increment or decrement the value. This dynamic text is then removed from the DOM after a few seconds (but not the actual container with `aria-live=\"polite\"`) so the message is not discovered by screen reader users after interaction. The content of this message dynamically created based on the `label` for the `select` and the current value of the `select`, e.g. \"Quantity updated, 4\".\n\n* The value of the `select` element naturally communicates the updated value to screen reader users so the live container is not updated when interacting with that form element.\n\n* The `button` and `aria-label` values should be plain text and should include context of what they affect when activated (typically the label for the `select`), e.g. \"Increase Quantity\" or \"Add Quantity\".\n\n* The buttons will need `aria-disabled=\"true\"` applied when either end of the range is reached.\n\n* Related alternative patterns: [Select dropdown](/web-criteria/component/select/) or an [WAI-ARIA Spin Button](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/spinbutton/examples/datepicker-spinbuttons/)."

While it seems like an obvious solution, without user testing in production environments you won't know how people are really going to interact with it.\n\n### Ask the following questions first\n\n* Where will this appear in the actual DOM (code) order?\n  * If it's injected at the top or bottom of the content, will it be cumbersome or impossible for someone using a keyboard or screen reader to locate it?\n* Is it preferable to place this content in multiple locations on the page?\n  * A \"Buy now\" button can appear more than once in the page.\n* Will this content be perceived as an ad and thus ignored by the customer?\n  * We've trained people for years to ignore sticky content in their browser offering app downloads and other ads. Why is your popup sticky content any different?\n\n## Code examples\n\n### Place the element in logical DOM order\n\nThis semantic HTML appears in logical order in the page.\n\nIt uses only CSS (no JavaScript) to float content as desired.\n\n```html\n\r\n<div class=\"sticky-wrapper\">\r\n  <div class=\"promo-bar sticky tops\">\r\n    <button>Upgrade today</button>\r\n    <p>Content that sticks to the top</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"vertical-spacer\">\r\n    <p><a href=\"/checklist-web/html/\">Web page content</a> \r\n    and <a href=\"/checklist-web/link/\">links</a>\r\n    or <a href=\"/checklist-web/button/\">buttons</a>\r\n    will be <a href=\"/how-to-test/\">read</a>  \r\n    in <a href=\"/checklist-web/html/\">DOM (code) order</a>.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"promo-bar\">\r\n  <button class=\"secondary\">See more</button>\r\n  <p>Content that is <em>not</em> sticky</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"vertical-spacer vertical-spacer--less\">\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"sticky-wrapper\">\r\n  <div class=\"vertical-spacer\">\r\n    <p><a href=\"/checklist-web/html/\">Web page content</a>\r\n    and <a href=\"/checklist-web/link/\">links</a>\r\n    or <a href=\"/checklist-web/button/\">buttons</a>\r\n    will be <a href=\"/how-to-test/\">read</a>  \r\n    in <a href=\"/checklist-web/html/\">DOM (code) order</a>.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"promo-bar sticky\">\r\n    <button>Buy now</button>\r\n    <p>Content that sticks to the bottom</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\n```\n\n<example>\r\n<div class=\"sticky-wrapper\">\r\n  <div class=\"promo-bar sticky top\">\r\n    <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary\">Upgrade today</button>\r\n    <p>Content that sticks to the top</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"vertical-spacer\">\r\n    <p><a href=\"/checklist-web/html/\">Web page content</a> \r\n    and <a href=\"/checklist-web/link/\">links</a>\r\n    or <a href=\"/checklist-web/button/\">buttons</a>\r\n    will be <a href=\"/how-to-test/\">read</a>  \r\n    in <a href=\"/checklist-web/html/\">DOM (code) order</a>.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"promo-bar\">\r\n  <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary\">See more</button>\r\n  <p>Content that is <em>not</em> sticky</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"vertical-spacer vertical-spacer--less\">\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"sticky-wrapper\">\r\n  <div class=\"vertical-spacer\">\r\n    <p><a href=\"/checklist-web/html/\">Web page content</a>\r\n    and <a href=\"/checklist-web/link/\">links</a>\r\n    or <a href=\"/checklist-web/button/\">buttons</a>\r\n    will be <a href=\"/how-to-test/\">read</a>  \r\n    in <a href=\"/checklist-web/html/\">DOM (code) order</a>.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"promo-bar sticky\">\r\n    <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary\">Buy now</button>\r\n    <p>Content that sticks to the bottom</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n</example>\n\n## Developer notes\n\n### Group\n\n* Must appear in logical page order within the page.\n* Do not place it at the actual end or beginning of the DOM\n* To ensure that controls which receive keyboard focus are not concealed by a sticky container, utilize CSS [scroll-padding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-padding) or [scroll-margin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-margin)."

          "developerNotes": "## Tab groups\n\nTabs can be useful in scenarios where content is repetitive and doesn't require direct comparison. In these instances, they can effectively organize information without compromising functionality. When implemented thoughtfully, tabs can enhance accessibility by simplifying navigation and helping users quickly locate the information they need.\n\nHowever, tab groups can also pose challenges for accessibility and usability when not implemented effectively. Poorly designed tab groups often lead to a cluttered presentation of content, which can detract from the overall user experience rather than enhance it. Ensuring that tab groups are thoughtfully structured is crucial for making content more accessible and user-friendly.\n\n### Potential issues with tab groups:\n\n* **Accessibility**: Many screen reader users struggle with navigating tab groups using arrow keys, potentially missing crucial content.\n* **Interaction Rates**: Engagement is typically low for content beyond the first tab panel.\n* **Visibility of Content**: Content is hidden by default, and not all users are aware of how to access it.\n* **Comparative Information**: Users cannot easily compare information presented across multiple tabs.\n\n### Recommended alternatives:\n\nInstead of using tab groups, consider these alternatives:\n\n* Breaking the page into clear sections with concise copywriting.\n* Use expandable sections (accordions) for better organization.\n* Create separate pages for different topics\n\n### Tab activation types:\n\nTabs can be built to be activated **automatically** or **manually**.\n\n* **Automatic** tabs become activated immediately upon focus via a mouse click or the arrow keys.\n* **Manual** tabs can receive focus via the arrow keys, but require the user to press either `Enter` or `Space`, or click them with their mouse to activate them.\n\nYou can find additional guidance as well as examples of automatic and manually activated tab groups on the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide Tabs Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/) page.\n\n### Code considerations\n\n* **Tablist**: The main container for tabs requires `role=\"tablist\"`.\n* **Tabs**: Each tab within the `tablist` requires `role=\"tab\"`.\n* **Content Panels**: Each content area for a tab is called a `role=\"tabpanel\"`.\n* **Labels**: Each `tabpanel` needs to have an `aria-labelledby` attribute that points to the corresponding `tab` label.\n* **Control Association**: Each `tab` has an `aria-controls` attribute linking it to its corresponding `tabpanel`.\n* **Active Tab**: The currently selected tab has `aria-selected` set to true; all other tabs have it set to false.\n* **Orientation**: If the tablist is vertical, it has `aria-orientation` set to vertical. By default, it is horizontal.\n\n### Code Example\n\n```html\n<div class=\"tabs\">\r\n  <div role=\"tablist\">\r\n    <button role=\"tab\"\r\n            aria-selected=\"true\" \r\n            aria-controls=\"alpha-tab\" \r\n            id=\"alpha\">\r\n            Alpha\r\n    </button>\r\n    <button role=\"tab\" \r\n            aria-selected=\"false\" \r\n            aria-controls=\"bravo-tab\" \r\n            id=\"bravo\" \r\n            tabindex=\"-1\">\r\n            Bravo\r\n    </button>\r\n    <button role=\"tab\" \r\n            aria-selected=\"false\" \r\n            aria-controls=\"charlie-tab\" \r\n            id=\"charlie\" \r\n            tabindex=\"-1\">\r\n            Charlie\r\n    </button>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div role=\"tabpanel\" \r\n       id=\"alpha-tab\" \r\n       aria-labelledby=\"alpha\"\r\n       tabindex=\"0\">\r\n    <p>Alpha is the first letter of the NATO alphabet</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div role=\"tabpanel\" \r\n       id=\"bravo-tab\" \r\n       aria-labelledby=\"bravo\"\r\n       tabindex=\"0\">\r\n    <p>Bravo is the second letter of the NATO alphabet</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div role=\"tabpanel\" \r\n       id=\"charlie-tab\" \r\n       aria-labelledby=\"charlie\"\r\n       tabindex=\"0\">\r\n    <p>Charlie is the third letter of the NATO alphabet</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\n```"

One of them is hidden from screen readers by use of `aria-hidden=\"true\"` and the other visually hidden container's content is dynamically updated after a slight pause. This is to ensure the screen reader does not interrupt the announcement of the key pressed with the announcement of the dynamic counter text update.\n* While the visible counter text container is hidden with `aria-hidden=\"true\"` it is still programmatically associated with the textarea by use of `aria-describedby`. This will ensure the text will be announced when the textarea receives focus.\n* **Delay the update** for dynamic `role=\"status\"` counter\n  * Use `setTimeout`to allow the accessibility tree and screen reader time to update in a logical fashion e.g. 1500ms\n* **Do not** reference the `role=\"status\"` element with aria-describedby\n  * This causes a bug in VoiceOver\n\n```javascript\nconst textarea = document.getElementById('message');\r\nif(textarea) {\r\n    const chars = document.getElementById('currentChars');\r\n    const srOutputTarget = document.getElementById('sr-counter-target');\r\n    textarea.addEventListener(\"input\", event => {\r\n        const target = event.currentTarget;\r\n        const maxLength = target.getAttribute(\"maxlength\");\r\n        const currentLength = target.value.length;\r\n        // update the visible counter text\r\n        chars.innerHTML = maxLength - currentLength;\r\n        // update the visually hidden counter text\r\n        setTimeout(function() {\r\n            srOutputTarget.innerHTML = maxLength - currentLength;\r\n        },1000);\r\n    });\r\n}\n```\n\n```html\n<label for=\"message\">\r\n  Your message\r\n</label>\r\n\r\n<textarea \r\n  id=\"message\"\r\n  maxlength=\"50\"\r\n  aria-describedby=\"charcounter\">\r\n</textarea>\r\n\r\n<div role=\"status\">\r\n  <!-- Do not reference the status element with aria-describedby \r\n       Doing so will not work in VoiceOver -->\r\n  <div id=\"charcounter\" class=\"hint\">\r\n    <span id=\"currentChars\">50</span> \r\n    of 50\r\n    <span class=\"hidden\">\r\n      characters remaining\r\n    </span>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\n```\n\n<!-- TODO JS for countdown of characters -->\n\n<example>\r\n   <label for=\"message\">\r\n   Your message\r\n   </label>\r\n   <textarea \r\n   id=\"message\"\r\n   maxlength=\"50\"\r\n   aria-describedby=\"charcounter\">\r\n   </textarea>\r\n   <div role=\"status\">\r\n   <!-- Do not reference the status element with aria-describedby \r\n         Doing so will not work in VoiceOver -->\r\n   <div id=\"charcounter\" class=\"hint\">\r\n      <span id=\"currentChars\">50</span> \r\n      of 50\r\n      <span class=\"hidden\">\r\n         characters remaining\r\n      </span>\r\n   </div>\r\n   </div>\r\n</example>"

          "developerNotes": "## Rethinking Toast Snackbars\n\nToast snackbars might seem like an easy way to provide feedback, but they’re often not the best fit for accessible and user-friendly design. Here’s why:\n\n* Accessibility Limitations: Because snackbars are custom HTML elements, they lack semantic meaning and can be challenging for assistive technologies like screen readers.\n* Missed Messages: If a user doesn’t catch a snackbar in time, it’s difficult to go back and review the information.\n* Auditory Clutter: For screen readers, snackbars can create unnecessary noise, especially if they appear frequently or unexpectedly.\n* Unclear Rules: Like tooltips, snackbars are tricky to define and test consistently in design criteria.\n\n### Instead use an inline element to indicate a change\n\n* Inline Feedback: Inject a success message *in proximity* to the updated control\n* Accessible Undo/Redo Options: Place these buttons in clear, easy-to-navigate locations.\n* Thoughtful Confirmations: Use a confirmation screen for critical actions or when users are exiting an important flow.\n\n<!-- TODO: Needs JS support to activate the toast!\r\n\r\n<example>\r\n<fieldset>\r\n  <legend>Marketing preferences</legend>\r\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"switch\" id=\"spam\" aria-describedby=\"hint-spam-message\" checked=\"\">\r\n  <label for=\"spam\">\r\n   Send me constant spam\r\n   </label>\r\n  <div id=\"hint-spam\" role=\"alert\" class=\"alert notification inert\">\r\n    <div id=\"hint-spam-message\">\r\n      - Use JS to inject the alert here (comment out in the future)\r\n    </div>     \r\n  </div>\r\n</fieldset>\r\n</example> -->\n\n### When Toast Snackbars Don’t Work:\n\nThere are certain scenarios where snackbars simply aren’t the right tool:\n\n* Critical or Irreversible Actions: For example, “Unsend this message” or “Confirm payment.” These require deliberate, visible feedback\n* Blocking Error Messages: Important errors should grab attention and provide clear guidance—not rely on a fleeting message.\n* Page-Load Alerts: Automatically showing messages on page load can confuse users, particularly those using screen readers.\n\n### Timing\n\nIf you find a situation where a toast snackbar is truly necessary:\n\n* Avoid auto-dismiss wherever possible.\n* If dismissal must be automatic, make sure the [timing is adjustable to meet WCAG 2.2.1 standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/timing-adjustable.html).\n\n## Only use toast snackbars to *reinforce* updates\n\n* If using a snackbar is unavoidable, it must only be used for non-critical messaging.\n* The status injected must also be discernable on the page *without the snackbar*.\n\n### Practical example\n\nGiven that I am on a dynamic single page application\n\n* WHEN the customer changes the state of a toggle to OFF or ON\n  * THEN the toast appears to *reinforce* that the change has been saved\n  * AND the customer can confirm this is true from the toggle itself\n\n## Code example\n\n```html\n<div id=\"toast\">\r\n  <span id=\"toast-message\" role=\"status\">\r\n    <!-- Inject snackbar message here -->\r\n  </span>\r\n  <button type=\"button\">\r\n    Dismiss\r\n  </button>\r\n</div>\n```"

Test keyboard only, then screen reader + keyboard actions\n   * Skip-links: Not commonly used for form entry, but useful for jumping to a form landmark.\n   * Tab: Focus moves to each form control in logical order, strong visual focus indicator.\n   * Forms mode: Enabled when screen reader lands on a form field.\n\n2. Test mobile screenreader gestures\n   * Swipe: Focus moves to form controls inside the form.\n   * Doubletap: Activates controls as expected.\n\n3. Listen to screenreader output on all devices\n   * Role: It is discoverable with screenreader shortcuts as a form landmark along with its name\n   * Name: If multiple forms are present (Ex: Search, Sign in, Newsletter subscription), the form must have a name.\n   * Group: Groups of related fields are identified with fieldset/legend or aria attributes.\n   * Instructions: Presented before the form or inline, announced in order.\n   * Errors: Errors are announced when inputs are invalid.\n\nFull information: [https://www.magentaa11y.com/#/web-criteria/page-level/form](/web-criteria/page-level/form)",

          "developerNotes": "## Building accessible forms\n\n### Do not auto focus inputs\n\n* Automatically moving focus to an input field is very confusing for people using assistive technology.\n\n### Group inputs\n\nUse `fieldset` and `legend` to group related fields, such as:\n\n* Sign in\n* Shipping address\n* Payment information\n\n### Error handling\n\n* Individual inputs must have [programmatically described errors](https://www.magentaa11y.com/checklist-web/hint-help-error/) read by the screen reader on focus.\n* For long forms, list all errors in an [alert](https://www.magentaa11y.com/checklist-web/alert/) with links back to each invalid input on submission attempts.\n\n## UX guidance\n\n### Affordance: field width indicates the expected input\n\nForm field width should afford the user space to enter the characters that will be required. Do not arbitrarily limit the width of names, usernames, passwords or emails.\n\nPractical Examples\n\n* Middle initial should be wide enough to accommodate 1 character\n* State abbreviations should be wide enough to accommodate 2 characters\n* Zip code must be wide enough to accommodate 5 characters\n* Pin numbers reflect the number of digits expected\n\n### Why we stack inputs\n\nDo not put forms in multiple columns.\n\n* People are accustomed to scrolling vertically. There is no advantage to making the page take up less vertical space.\n* People with low vision may be using a zoom tool, enlarging the view of their screen and thus only seeing a portion of the form. If there is a column on the right side, it will be difficult to discover the fields.\n* Do not place submit buttons in a sidebar unless there is also a submit button at the bottom of the form\n\n### Why we use autocomplete\n\n* Utilizing [autocomplete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/autocomplete) allows users automated assistance in filling out form field values.\n* Autocomplete is helpful for all customers leading to a speedier conversion\n* For those with motor disabilities, it eliminates the need to laboriously enter information\n\n## Code examples\n\n### Use semantic HTML\n\n```html\n<form aria-label=\"Sign in\">\r\n  <fieldset>\r\n    <legend>Sign in</legend>\r\n    <label for=\"username\">Username</label>\r\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\">\r\n    <button type=\"submit\">Sign in</button>\r\n  </fieldset>\r\n</form>\n```\n\n<example>\r\n    <form aria-label=\"Sign in\">\r\n      <fieldset>\r\n        <legend>Sign in</legend>\r\n        <label for=\"username\">Username</label>\r\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\">\r\n        <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary\" type=\"submit\">Sign in</button>\r\n      </fieldset>\r\n    </form>\r\n</example>\n\n### Credit card information\n\nUse `fieldset` and `legend` to group related fields, such as:\n\n* This form uses minimal unobtrusive masking to make the credit card number more readable. (When done poorly, masking can can cause the field to be read repeatedly as the mask refreshes)\n* Autofill attributes to help customers complete fields with less effort.\n* Using `inputmode=\"numeric\"` brings up the numeric keyboard on mobile devices making entry easier.\n\n```html\n<form aria-label=\"Payment information\">\r\n  <fieldset>\r\n    <legend>\r\n      Enter your

Primarily, let the device manage default focus\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes needs focus management\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place (back button, screen title, first text field, first heading), except when changing between navigation tabs\n* When a menu, picker or modal is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n#### Android Views\n\n* `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API\n* `android:focusable`\n* `android=clickable`\n* Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`\n* `nextFocusDown`\n* `nextFocusUp`\n* `nextFocusRight`\n* `nextFocusLeft`\n* `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)\n* To hide controls: `importantForAccessibility=false`\n* For a `ViewGroup`, set `screenReaderFocusable=true` and each inner object’s attribute to keyboard focus (`focusable=false`)\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n* `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable\n* `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with FocusRequesters to define focus order\n* `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state\n* `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views\n* Example: To customize the focus events\n  * step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`\n  * step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`\n  * focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end\n  * step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus\n\n***\n\n### Custom Accessibility Action\n\n* When UI elements are customized and coded to look like a specific component say button, to ensure that name, role, state and action are all intact might need to update accessibility service and semantics.\n* Disclaimer: This customization would not be needed unless it is required to modify/add gestures or actions.\n* The Button class by default supplies all the necessary semantics to make it fully accessible.\n\n#### Android Views\n\n* step 1: Create an accessibility service\n* step 2: Add the `FLAG_REQUEST_ACCESSIBILITY_BUTTON` flag in an AccessibilityServiceInfo object's `android:accessibilityFlags` attribute\n* step 3: To have a custom service register for the button's custom action callbacks, use `registerAccessibilityButtonCallback()`\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n* List of custom accessibility actions can be defined relatively easily in compose compared to Views using customActions.\n* Example: `modifier = Modifier.semantics { customActions = listOf(CustomAccessibilityAction(label = \"\", action = { true }))}`\n\n***\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* \"button\" in announcements below comes from the accessibility services most of the time when a native component is used, not from \"button\" in the label\n  * **Note:** When the user has hints turned on in settings, \"double tap to activate\" will announce at the end of most interactive controls.  Testing should be done with hints turned on to ensure the user understands a control is interactive by hearing either \"button\" or \"double tap to activate\" or both.  Announcements on Android devices vary slightly due to manufacturer.\n* \"Label, button, double tap to activate\"\n* \"Label, (other content in cell), button, double tap to activate\" (grouping)\n* \"Label, button, selected, double tap to activate\" (selected state)\n* \"Label, disabled\" (disabled state)",
          "iosDeveloperNotes": "* A button is accessible by default prior to customization. Use the native button when at all possible to avoid additional development effort\n* A button is a control that executes an action or navigates within the app\n  * To redirect users outside of the app, use links\n* Even if the control visibly looks like a link, implement the control as a button to cue the screen reader that the action will keep them within the app\n* Name, Role, State must be stated in a single announcement when focus is on the control\n\n***\n\n### Name\n\n* Name describes the purpose of the control.\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note**: Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.\n* When naming a button, do not add “button” to the programmatic name (label). Assigning “Button” as the role will handle this announcement.\n  * **Incorrect announcement**: “Submit button, Button”\n  * **Correct announcement**: “Submit, Button”\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n  * The button’s title will overwrite the button’s `accessibilityLabel`.\n* If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the button’s `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n  * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n* To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label’s `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n* To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `AccessibilityEnabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n* If button has icon(s), hide the icon(s) from VoiceOver by using view modifier `accessibilityHidden(true)`.\n\n***\n\n### Role\n\n* When using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* Use `UIButton`\n* If necessary, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.button`.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* Use native `Button` view\n* If necessary, use view modifier `accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)` to assign the role as `Button`.\n* If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits.\n\n***\n\n### Groupings\n\nGroup visible label with button, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the button and not duplicate the name announcement\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n* Set `isAccessibilityElement` to true for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n* If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n  * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n* Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n* Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildre`n to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* Use view `modifier accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n***\n\n### State\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n* For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is “Dimmed”.\n  * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* For selected, use `accessibilityAddTraits(.isSelected)`.\n* For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n***\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading, except when changing between navigation tabs\n* When a menu, picker, or modal is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n  * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n* Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n* `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n* If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n***\n\n### Announcement examples\n\nOptions for announcements below depend on implementation. Announcement order can vary.\n\n* \"Label, button\"\n* \"Label, (other content in cell), button\" (grouping)\n* \"Label, button, selected\" (selected state)\n* \"Label, dimmed, button\" (disabled state)\n\n***",

Each interactive component in audio challenge identifies as a button or edit box\n\n#### **Android Views**\n\n* When not using native controls (ie, custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n* Standard button or ImageButton\n\n#### **Jetpack Compose**\n\n* Standard `Button` composable\n\n### Groupings\n\n#### **Android Views**\n\n* `ViewGroup`\n* Set the container object's `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false. In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement.\n\n#### **Jetpack Compose**\n\n* `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true) {}` is equivalent to `importantForAccessibility` when compared to android views\n* `FocusRequester.createRefs()` helps to request focus to inner elements with in the group\n\n### State\n\n* Experiences (refer to number above):\n  1. If grouped in table row, it's possible for the whole row to have a disabled state, or the captcha button disabled separately\n  2. Image button can have a disabled state (disabled)\n  3. Buttons in audio challenge can have a disabled state (disabled)\n\n#### **Android Views**\n\n* Active: `android:enabled=true`\n* Disabled: `android:enabled=false`. Announcement: disabled\n\n#### **Jetpack Compose**\n\n* Active: default state is active and enabled. Use `Button(enabled = true)` to specify explicitly\n* Disabled: `Button(enabled = false)` announces as disabled\n* Alternatively can use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { disabled() }` to announce as disabled\n* Use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { stateDescription = \"\" }` to have a customized state announcement\n\n### Focus\n\n* Experiences (refer to number above):\n  1. Focus is on the whole table row. There should be no focus on any single element, if the whole table row is grouped together, as long as there is only one interactive element per row.\n  2. The image button receives focus by swipe or touch\n  3. Each element in audio challenge receives focus by swipe or touch. User is confined inside a modal, if presented\n* Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place (back button, screen title, first text field, first heading)\n\n#### **Android Views**\n\n* `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API\n* `android:focusable`\n* `android=clickable`\n* Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`\n* `nextFocusDown`\n* `nextFocusUp`\n* `nextFocusRight`\n* `nextFocusLeft`\n* `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)\n* To hide controls: `importantForAccessibility=false`\n* For a `ViewGroup`, set `screenReaderFocusable=true` and each inner object’s attribute to keyboard focus (`focusable=false`)\n\n#### **Jetpack Compose**\n\n* `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable\n* `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with FocusRequesters to define focus order\n* `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state\n* `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views\n* Example: To customize the focus events\n  * step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`\n  * step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`\n  * focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end\n  * step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus\n\n### Custom Accessibility Action\n\n* When UI elements are customized and coded to look like a specific component say button, to ensure that name, role, state and action are all intact might need to update accessibility service and semantics.\n* Disclaimer: This customization would not be needed unless it is required to modify/add gestures or actions.\n* The Button class by default supplies all the necessary semantics to make it fully accessible.\n\n#### **Android Views**\n\n* step 1: Create an accessibility service\n* step 2: Add the `FLAG_REQUEST_ACCESSIBILITY_BUTTON` flag in an AccessibilityServiceInfo object's `android:accessibilityFlags` attribute\n* step 3: To have a custom service register for the button's custom action callbacks, use `registerAccessibilityButtonCallback()`\n\n#### **Jetpack Compose**\n\n* List of custom accessibility actions can be defined relatively easily in compose compared to Views using customActions.\n* Example: `modifier = Modifier.semantics { customActions = listOf(CustomAccessibilityAction(label = \"\", action = { true }))}`",
          "iosDeveloperNotes": "* Here are just a few experiences for Captcha:\n  1. A non-interactive image in a table row, where the whole table row acts like a button.\n  2. A single interactive element, like an image button\n  3. An audio challenge as an equivalent experience to the image challenge\n* When selecting the type of Captcha, do not limit the options to only <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/accessible-authentication-minimum.html#dfn-cognitive-function-test\">cognitive function tests</a> (e.g. remembering or transcribing a word, or recognizing a picture the website provided).

Identifies as an image\n  2. Identifies as an image button\n  3. Each interactive component in audio challenge identifies as a button or text field\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* Use `UIButton`\n* If necessary, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.button`\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* Use native `Button` view\n* If necessary, use view modifier `accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)` to assign the role as Button\n* If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits\n\n### Groupings\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n* Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n  * If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n    * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n### State\n\n* Experiences (refer to number above):\n  1. If grouped in table row, it's possible for the whole row to have a dimmed/disabled state, or the captcha button disabled separately\n  2. Image button can have a disabled state (dimmed)\n  3. Buttons in audio challenge can have a disabled state (dimmed)\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n* For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n  * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* For selected, use `accessibilityAddTraits(.isSelected)`\n* For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`\n\n### Focus\n\n* Experiences (refer to number above):\n  1. Focus is on the whole table row. There should be no focus on any single element, if the whole table row is grouped together, as long as there is only one interactive element per row.\n  2. The image button receives focus by swipe or touch\n  3. Each element in audio challenge receives focus by swipe or touch. User is confined inside a modal, if presented\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading.\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n  * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n* Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n* `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n* If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.",

Swiping right through the slides of a very large number of slides to get to the next element past the carousel would not be a good user experience.\n* The container around the carousel on Android can be an alternative for the user to bypass all the slides.  The user can enter the container to navigate through the slides, or swipe to the next element past the container.\n  * When navigating to a carousel with the screen reader, it should first focus on the entire carousel container\n  * Each carousel may have a different number of items, so the label includes the total amount of items and the current item in focus\n  * Then, activating the carousel container focuses on the first carousel item\n  * Two finger swipe rt or left navigates through the slides putting focus on the next slide in the order\n* Alternate implementation to swiping through carousel: Change the slides with interactive page control dots and dynamically announce all the content in the slide along with page index (without focus on slides, just on the dots)\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name of any interactive element describes it's purpose.\n\n* Each item in the carousel, if interactive, has a name that describes the purpose of the control and matches any visible label/all text and image descriptions within item.\n\n* **Android View**\n  * `android:text` XML attribute\n  * Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name, depending on type of view and for elements without a visible label.\n  * `contentDescription` overrides `android:text`\n  * Use `labelFor` attribute to associate the visible label to the control\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * If no visible label, use compose modifier semantics `contentDescription`.\n  * If any icons or images need to be hidden for accessibility talkback, use compose modifier semantics `invisibleToUser()`\n\n### Role\n\n* The native Pager component will handle the built-in accessibility behavior\n\n* Each item in the carousel can have the independent role and accessibility trait.

          "iosDeveloperNotes": "### General Notes\n\n* A carousel is a list of related content items as a horizontal slideshow\n* There are a variety of implementation alternatives for a carousel. At least one of the options in the above success criteria for navigating through the elements/slides must be available\n* Slides cannot automatically start rotating through carousel unless there is a pause/stop button\n* Consider the number of slides/elements in carousel when choosing implementation.  Swiping right through the slides of a very large number of slides to get to the next element past the carousel would not be a good user experience. Custom actions/gestures for navigation through the slides should be considered on large carousels on iOS.  Then, if the user wants to bypass all the slides, they would simply swipe right to the next element past the carousel\n* Alternate implementation to swiping through carousel: Change the slides with interactive page control dots and dynamically announce all the content in the slide along with page index (without focus on slides, only on the dots)\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name of any interactive element describes it's purpose\n\n* Append \", Carousel\" to the programmatic name to announce the role, since the carousel is custom and does not have a native role assigned\n\n* If visible text label exists for an interactive component, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n    * The carousel's title will overwrite the carousel's `accessibilityLabel`.\n  * If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the carousel's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n  * If button has icon(s), hide the icon(s) from VoiceOver by using view modifier `accessibilityHidden(true)`.\n\n### Role\n\n* Since there is no native carousel component, a custom carousel must be implemented.\n\n* The carousel itself has its own role indicated by appending \", Carousel\" to the programmatic name.\n\n* Each item in the carousel has its own independent role or accessibility trait. For example, if the item is interactive, the role will be `.button`.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * A common method of implementing a carousel involves using `UICollectionView` and its corresponding protocols. Each item of the carousel is a `UICollectionViewCell`.\n  * Set the `accessibilityTraits` of the overall carousel role to `.adjustable`, and then append \", Carousel\" to the programmatic name to notify the user of the role\n  * An individual item of the carousel will have its own role that is dependent on whether it is interactive. Assign the role that best fits your use case.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * As there are different ways to implement a carousel, use your best judgment for your use case.\n  * Append \", Carousel\" to the programmatic name for the overall carousel\n  * An individual item of the carousel will have its own role that is dependent on whether it is interactive. Assign the role that best fits your use case.\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityAddTraits(:)` to add traits.\n  * If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits.\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with the carousel, if applicable.\n\n* Group the title and any description with each item in the carousel.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n    * If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n      * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n### State\n\n* Indicate where the item is in the carousel by announcing the position/index out of the total number of items. (see Announcements below)\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Custom Gestures\n\n* The expected experience is that when users swipe left or right, they are navigating from one section of the screen to another. When users swipe up or down on the carousel, the user is scrolling through the carousel\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * First, ensure that the accessibility trait of the carousel is `.adjustable`.\n  * Then, you are able to take advantage of the `accessibilityIncrement` and `accessibilityDecrement` methods\n\n  ```swift\n  override func accessibilityIncrement() {\r\n      // Move forward one item\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  override func accessibilityDecrement() {\r\n      // Move backward one item\r\n\r\n  }\n  ```\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * There are many approaches to applying custom gestures to a component\n  * One suggestion is to use `.accessibilityAdjustableAction` with a `switch` statement for the `direction`, and changing the index of the cell depending on whether the direction is `.increment` or `.decrement`\n\n    * \"Incrementing\" should move to the next item\n    * \"Decrementing\" should move to the previous item\n\n    ```swift\n    .accessibilityAdjustableAction { direction in\r\n        switch direction {\r\n        case .increment:\r\n            // Go to next page\r\n\r\n        case .decrement:\r\n            // Go to previous page\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\n    ```\n\n### Announcements\n\n* “Showing slides x of y” are common announcements to give screen readers context of layout\n* “Custom actions available.

It should not automatically navigate the user to another field or screen when activated, as that may cause a change of context. Revealing new information on the same screen as a result of activating a checkbox is usually ok, as it is not a change of context.\n* Name, Role, State must be announced when focus is on the control. Announcing the label only in a separate swipe before the checkbox does not meet this requirement.\n\n#### Code example\n\n```java\nval checkedState = remember { mutableStateOf(true) }\r\nval stateNotSubscribed = \"Not Selected\"\r\nval stateSubscribed = \"Selected\"\r\nRow(\r\n  modifier = Modifier\r\n        .semantics {\r\n            stateDescription = if (checkedState.value) { stateSubscribed } else { stateNotSubscribed }\r\n            contentDescription = \"Subscribe\"\r\n        }\r\n        .toggleable(\r\n            value = checkedState.value,\r\n            onValueChange = { checkedState.value = it },\r\n            role = Role.Checkbox\r\n        )\r\n  ) {\r\n    Checkbox(\r\n            modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.CenterVertically),\r\n            checked = checkedState.value,\r\n            onCheckedChange = null\r\n    )\r\n        Text(text = \"Subscription\")\r\n    }\n```\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control\n\n* Programmatic name matches the visible text label\n\n* **Android Views**\n  * `android:text` XML attribute\n  * Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name, depending on type of view and for elements (icons) without a visible label\n  * `contentDescription` overrides `android:text`\n  * Use `labelFor` attribute to associate the visible label with the control (best practice)\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * By default, the simple checkbox composable is readout & focused separately from its label text, which makes it hard to understand the context.\n  * Use `Row` composable and `toggleable(role = Role.Checkbox)` with inner element as `Checkbox` composable (recommended practice) to have entire row including its label focused for selection, so it allows screenreader to read the name and role together.\n  * Optional: use `Modifier.semantics {  contentDescription = \"\" }` for a more descriptive name\n\n### Role\n\n* When not using native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n* **Android Views**\n  * CheckBox Class\n  * Announced as \"checkbox\"\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * Simple checkbox composable.\n  * Alternatively use checkbox composable in combination with `Row` and `toggleable(role = Role.Checkbox)`. Code example above.\n  * Announced as \"checkbox\"\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with button (if applicable) to provide a programmatic name for the button\n\n* **Android Views**\n  * ViewGroup\n  * Set the container object's `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false. In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement.\n  * use `labelFor`\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true) {}` is equivalent to importantForAccessibility when compared to android views.\n  * To allow checkbox grouping, specify `onCheckedChange = null` on inner simple checkbox composable when combined with `Row` composable and `toggleable(value = checkedState.value, onValueChange = { checkedState.value = it })`. This makes the entire row group selectable including its label.\n  * `FocusRequester` can be used to request focus to individual components with in the group. More on FocusRequester in the focus section below.\n\n### State\n\n* When native code is not available for a state, add the state to the programmatic name (label).  Add logic when needed.\n\n* **Android Views**\n  * Active: `android:enabled=true`, `isChecked`, `setChecked`\n  * Disabled: `android:enabled=false` announced as: \"disabled\"\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * Checked: `Checkbox(checked = true)` announced as: \"checked\"\n  * Enabled:  `Checkbox(enabled = true)`\n  * Disabled: `Checkbox(enabled = false)` announced as: \"disabled\"\n  * When using checkbox composable with row and toggleable, need to specify `Modifier.toggleable(enabled = false)` along with `Checkbox(enabled = false)`\n  * Use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { stateDescription = \"\" }` to have a customized state announcement.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Only manage focus when needed.

          "iosDeveloperNotes": "### General Notes\n\n* A check box lets the user choose between two opposite states, actions or values\n* You should use a native app control when at all possible vs a custom element, as it will automatically and correctly announce the role without additional development effort\n* A check box should toggle between checked and unchecked. It should not automatically navigate the user to another field or screen when activated, as that may cause a change of context. Revealing new information on the same screen as a result of activating a checkbox is usually ok, as it is not a change of context\n* Name, Role, State must be announced when focus is on the control. Announcing the label only in a separate swipe before the checkbox does not meet this requirement\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control.\n\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n    * The checkbox's title will overwrite the checkbox's `accessibilityLabel`.\n  * If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the button's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * By default, the visible label of a Toggle is the accessibility label\n  * If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n\n### Role\n\n* When using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * Since there is no native checkbox in UIKit, implementing a custom checkbox may be necessary using `UIButton`, `UISwitch`, `UIControl`, or another class.\n    * Extend from one of the UIKit native controls above. A common control for custom checkboxes to extend from is the `UIButton`, but choose the native control that best fits your use case.\n    * Provide your own checked and unchecked checkbox images\n    * Implement action handlers for your custom checkbox\n    * Set accessibility properties accordingly\n  * If necessary, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.button`. Be sure to set the accessibility value to either \"Checked\" or \"Unchecked\" to indicate that this control behaves as a checkbox.\n  * An alternative to setting the accessibility trait to `.button` is removing and hiding the accessibility trait using `accessibilityTraits.remove(:)`. Then, append \", Checkbox\" to the programmatic name\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use native `Toggle` view with `toggleStyle(.checkbox)`\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with checkbox, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the checkbox.\n\n* Group the units such that the label, role, and state of the checkbox is announced in a single announcement.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n  * If frame does not exist, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n    * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n  * If the tap gesture is removed due to grouping logic, restore the tap gesture functionality using bindings to bind the tap gesture of the container with the state of the checkbox.\n\n### State\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * For checked state: Set `accessibilityValue` to \"Checked\"\n  * For unchecked state: Optionally, set `accessibilityValue` to \"Unchecked\"\n  * For enabled state: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For checked state, if necessary: Set accessibility value to \"Checked\" with `accessibility(:)`\n  * For unchecked state, if necessary: Set accessibility value to \"Unchecked\" with `accessibilityValue(:)`\n  * For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* Appending checkbox to label:\n* \"Label checkbox, checked, button\"\n* \"Label checkbox, not checked, button\"  (not checked or \"unselected\" are acceptable)\n* Not appending to label:\n* \"Label, checked, button\"\n* \"Label, not checked, button\"  (both \"not checked\" or \"unselected\" are acceptable)",

          "iosDeveloperNotes": "### General Notes\n\n* For iOS, VoiceOver generally moves focus to the picker options when it opens\n* A \"Done\" button closes picker\n* Screen reader focus should move back to the button that opened the picker originally\n* At first swipe to the input, it may announce as a textfield, but once clicked on you will hear \"adjustable\" and now you will be inside the time/date picker\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control that opens the picker.\n\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.\n\n* Placeholder text is NOT the programmatic name\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n    * The triggering element's title will overwrite its's `accessibilityLabel`.\n  * If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the date picker's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * If no visible label is present, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n\n#### Role\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Use `UIPickerView`\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Use native `Picker` view with `WheelPickerStyle`\n  * If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits.\n\n#### Groupings\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n    * If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n      * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n#### State\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`.\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n\n**SwiftUI**\n\n* For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n#### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading.\n\n* When the picker is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n* If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n  * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n\n* Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n\n* `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n#### Announcement examples\n\n* For button that opens time/date picker: \"Birthday, button, activate to choose type, actions available\"\n* Value is announced along with role when picker opens: \"November, picker item, adjustable\"\n* Announcement for disabled state is \"dimmed\"",

          "iosDeveloperNotes": "There is no native dropdown element for iOS.  The notes below are suggestions and accessibility guidance.\n\n### General Notes\n\n* A dropdown is a button that opens a list of options.  When an option is chosen, it displays in the field as the value\n* The difference between a menu and dropdown is a menu item performs an action when activated.  A dropdown item only replaces the current option\n* The screen reader focus moves directly to first option in dropdown upon double tapping the dropdown button and is confined in the list.\n* Sometimes, a hidden \"dismiss context menu\" button after the last item is available to close it.\n* Focus should go back to the triggering dropdown button, displaying the new option\n* There must be a visible label for the dropdown field that is not a placeholder and it describes the purpose of the dropdown.\n* The screen reader focus also remains confined in the dropdown list\n* The state of expanded or collapsed should be announced\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control.\n\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognition\n\n* When naming a button, do not add \"button\" to the programmatic name (label). Assigning \"Button\" as the role will handle this announcement.\n  * **Incorrect announcement:** \"Submit button, Button\"\n  * **Correct announcement:** \"Submit, Button\"\n\n* Placeholder or value text is NOT the programmatic name\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n    * The button’s title will overwrite the button’s `accessibilityLabel`.\n  * If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the button's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n  * If button has icon(s), hide the icon(s) from VoiceOver by using view modifier `accessibilityHidden(true)`.\n\n### Role\n\n* When using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n* One option is to use a table view and a button inside a UIStackView\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * Use `UIButton`\n  * If necessary, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.button`.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use native `Button` view\n  * If necessary, use view modifier `accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)` to assign the role as Button.\n  * If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits.\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with button, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the button.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n    * If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n      * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n### State\n\n* In the case of expandable dropdowns, state of the dropdown must be announced (i.e. expanded/collapsed). Add logic and announcements to the programmatic name for the state.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * If applicable, dropdown items should be announced whether they are selected/unselected, in the cases of radio buttons or checkboxes.\n  * For enabled dropdown items: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled dropdown items: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the dropdown item to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the dropdown item.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * If applicable, dropdown items should be announced whether they are selected/unselected, in the cases of radio buttons or checkboxes.\n  * For selected dropdown items, use `accessibilityAddTraits(.isSelected)`.\n  * For disabled dropdown items, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading.\n\n* When a menu, picker, or modal is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* \"Button label, chosen option label, button, collapsed\"  (Button that opens dropdown with selected option from dropdown and state)\n* \"Selected, chosen option label, button\" (Selected option in dropdown list)\n* \"Label, button\" (Other options in list that populate dropdown)\n* \"Dismiss context menu, button\"  (Optional Hidden button that closes dropdown)",

In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement.\n\n#### **Android Compose**\n\n* `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true) {}` for the child elements grouping/merging\n* `FocusRequester.createRefs()` helps to request focus to inner elements with in the group\n\n### State\n\n#### **Android Views**\n\n* Active: `android:enabled=true`\n* Disabled: `android:enabled=false`\n* Announcement: disabled\n\n#### **Android Compose**\n\n* Active: default state is active and enabled. Use `RadioButton(enabled = true)` to specify explicitly\n* Disabled:  `RadioButton(enabled = false)` announces as disabled\n* Alternatively can use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { disabled() }` to announce as disabled\n* Use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { stateDescription = \"\" }` to have a customized state announcement\n\n### Focus\n\n* Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus order\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views or containers\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes needs focus management\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading\n* When a link is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element\n\n#### **Android Views**\n\n* `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API\n* `android:focusable`\n* `android=clickable`\n* Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`\n* `nextFocusDown`\n* `nextFocusUp`\n* `nextFocusRight`\n* `nextFocusLeft`\n* `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)\n* To hide controls: `Important_For_Accessibility_false`\n* For a `ViewGroup`, set `screenReaderFocusable=true` and each inner object’s attribute to keyboard focus (`focusable=false`)\n\n#### **Android Compose**\n\n* `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable\n* `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with FocusRequesters to define focus order\n* `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state\n* `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views\n* *Example:* To customize the focus events behaviour or the sequence of focus,\n  * step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`\n  * step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`\n  * focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end\n  * step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus\n\n### Code Example\n\n#### **Jetpack Compose**\n\n```java\n   /**\r\n   * Custom Composable with AndroidView to support link in textView and the links accessibility features from talkback menu\r\n   */\r\n   @Composable\r\n   fun LinkText(\r\n      modifier: Modifier = Modifier,\r\n      textBody: String\r\n   ) {\r\n      AndroidView(\r\n         modifier = modifier,\r\n         factory = { context ->\r\n               TextView(context).apply {\r\n                  text = SpannableString(textBody)\r\n                  LinkifyCompat.addLinks(this, Linkify.WEB_URLS)\r\n                  movementMethod = LinkMovementMethod.getInstance()\r\n               }\r\n         }\r\n      )\r\n   }\n```\n\n### Further reading\n\n* [Handling Android App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links)\n\n### Announcement examples\n\nOptions for announcements below depend on device framework and versions. Announcement order can vary. \"Double tap to activate\" hint announcement varies with implementation.\n\n* \"Label, link\"\n* \"Label, link, double tap to activate\"\n* \"Label, double tap to activate, links available, tap with three fingers to view\" (TalkBack menu appears)\n* \"All text in paragraph including link name, links available, tap with three fingers to view\" (link in paragraph)\n* \"Text in sentence, link name, link, remainder of sentence, double tap to activate, links available, tap with three fingers to view\" (link in sentence with separate link focus)\n* \"Label, disabled\" (disabled)",
          "iosDeveloperNotes": "### **Developer Notes**\n\n* Actionable link that navigates the user outside of the app to a web page (ex: opens a web browser).\n* When accessing an in-line link that is inside a paragraph with a screen reader, the focus is usually around the paragraph container.\n* To activate a link, screen reader users can double tap both inline links and links outside of paragraphs.\n* There should only be a single inline link inside of a paragraph. Screen readers can only access the first link in the paragraph.\n* The correct execution of native app controls informs assistive technologies, such as voice control, screen readers, and switch access, that the element is interactive.\n\n### Name\n\n* Interactive text that describes the destination or purpose of the link\n* Programmatic name matches the visible text label\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.\n  * **Note:** If adding context to a generic link, ensure the visible text for the link is the first part of the label and it matches the visible text. For example, a link the has a visual label of \"Learn more\" that is not part of a paragraph may need a label with greater context in the code so it is announced by a screen reader as \"Learn more about accessible controls\".\n  * **Note:** If adding context to a generic link, ensure the visible text for the link is the first part of the label and it matches the visible text.

Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n  * If frame does not exist due to custom development, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n    * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n* After grouping the paragraph and the in-line link to form a single accessibility element, bind the link action to it.\n  * For the screen reader experience, focus will surround the paragraph container. Double-tapping the paragraph will activate the link.\n  * For the non-screen reader experience, do not bind the link action to the paragraph container. Non-screen readers must tap on the link itself to activate the link.\n\n### State\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n* For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n  * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the link to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the link.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading.\n* When a link is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* Implement focus ring to be around the paragraph container, so that double-tapping the container will activate the in-line link, given that there is only one link inside the container.\n* If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n  * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n* `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* Implement focus ring to be around the paragraph container, so that double-tapping the container will activate the in-line link, given that there is only one link inside the container.\n* For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n* If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* Announcement order can vary\n* \"Label, link\"\n* \"All text in paragraph including url, link\" (link in paragraph)\n* \"Label, dimmed, link\" (disabled)\n\n### Further reading\n\n* [UIAccessibilityTraits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilitytraits)",

Ensure this button is in the swipe order, if implemented.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* Options for announcements below depend on framework and versions. Announcement order can vary. \"Menu\" in label is optional, but recommended.\n* \"Label menu, button\"\n* \"Label, button\" (without recommended \"menu\" announcement)\n* \"Label menu, dimmed, button\" (disabled state)\n* \"Dismiss context menu, button\" (Invisible button in swipe past the last item in menu)",

If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognition.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n    * The \\_component title will overwrite the \\_component `accessibilityLabel`.\n  * If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the \\_component `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n\n### Role\n\n* When using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n* Follow code guidance for Button control. Ensure “draggable” is also announced.\n\n### State\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the \\_component to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the control.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For selected, use `accessibilityAddTraits(.isSelected)`.\n  * For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples for editing Keyboards in Settings\n\n* \"Remove, English US, button\" (Option to delete row - Delete button appears and announces as \"Delete, button\"\n* \"Reorder, English, button, draggable, double tap and hold, wait for the sound, then drag to rearrange\" (on three-line reorder button)\n* \"Moved below Spanish\" (After double tap and hold and two-click sound is heard, slowly drag up or down, waiting for the row above or below to announce.

          "androidDeveloperNotes": "### General Notes\n\n* A sheet helps people perform a distinct task that’s related to the parent view without taking them away from their current context\n* Use native elements when at all possible vs a custom element, as it will handle expected behavior without additional development effort\n* Most sheets appear as a modal that partially covers the underlying content.\n* The screen reader is usually confined in the sheet/drawer if it covers underlining content. If a sheet does not cover other content, the screen reader can move out of it\n* Swipe anywhere on the screen dismisses the sheet\n* A grabber at the top of the sheet is used to expand/collapse if needed. When implemented, the initial focus is on the grabber\n* A grabber expands/collapses the sheet to cover half the screen or the whole screen. Even though two finger swipe will expand the sheet, the user has to start the swipe with fingers on the drawer, which may be a challenge to those who cannot see the screen. Keyboard users would not be able to expand the sheet without the grabber\n\n### Name\n\n* Name describes the purpose of the control\n\n* Ensure that the button that activates the sheet has a programmatic name. The sheet does not have one as it is implied by the button's programmatic name.\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * `android:text` XML attribute\n  * Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name, depending on type of view and for elements (icons) without a visible label\n  * `contentDescription` overrides `android:text`\n  * Use `labelFor` attribute to associate the visible label with the control\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * Compose uses semantics properties to pass information to accessibility services.\n  * The built-in Button composable will fill the semantics properties with information inferred from the composable by default.\n  * Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name to override the default visible label of the button text.\n  * Example specification of contentDescription in compose: `modifier = Modifier.semantics { contentDescription = \"\" }`\n\n### Role\n\n* When not using native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * `ModalBottomSheet`\n  * Grabber announces as \"double tap to activate\"\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * `ModalBottomSheet`\n  * `BottomSheetScaffold`\n  * When use the drag handle on top of the sheet from the native component then it will be announced as \"collapse drag handle\" with actions available (three fingers tapping to view). With no drag handle designed UI, a close button is required to be displayed and have the init focus whenever the sheet is triggered and showing.\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group elements together logically to better understand the context of the screen\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * `ViewGroup`\n  * Set the container object's `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false. In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement.\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true) {}` is equivalent to `importantForAccessibility` when compared to android views\n  * `FocusRequester.createRefs()` helps to request focus to inner elements with in the group\n\n### State\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * Grabber, if any, announces as expands/collapses\n  * Active: `android:enabled=true`\n  * Disabled: `android:enabled=false`. Announcement: \"disabled\"\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * Partial expanded bottom sheet: Drag handle, if any, announces as \"collapse drag handle\" with actions available in taleback menu (Expand/Dismiss)\n  * Full expanded bottom sheet: Drag handle, if any, announces as \"expanded drag handle\" with actions available in talkback menu (Collapse/Dismiss)\n  * Full expanded bottom sheet with no partial expanded state: Drag handle, if any, announces as \"drag handle\" with actions available in talkback menu (Dismiss)\n  * Fixed bottom sheet with Close button and no drag handle: Close button state:\n    * Active: default state is active and enabled. Use `Button(enabled = true)` to specify explicitly\n    * Disabled: `Button(enabled = false)` announces as disabled\n    * Alternatively can use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { disabled() }` to announce as disabled\n\n### Focus\n\n* Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views\n\n* Moving focus into the sheet when an action opens it makes it clear to the screen reader user that there is a sheet available\n\n* When the sheet is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes needs focus management\n\n* Initial focus on the sheet should land on the grabber\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API\n  * `android:focusable`\n  * `android=clickable`\n  * Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`\n  * `nextFocusDown`\n  * `nextFocusUp`\n  * `nextFocusRight`\n  * `nextFocusLeft`\n  * `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)\n  * To hide controls: `importantForAccessibility=false`\n  * For a `ViewGroup`, set `screenReaderFocusable=true` and each inner object’s attribute to keyboard focus (`focusable=false`)\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable\n  * `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with FocusRequesters to define focus order\n  * `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state\n  * `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views\n  * Example: To customize the focus events\n    * step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`\n    * step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`\n    * focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end\n    * step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus\n\n### Code example\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n```java\nvar openBottomSheet by rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(false) }\r\nval scope = rememberCoroutineScope()\r\nval bottomSheetState = rememberModalBottomSheetState()\r\nButton(onClick = { openBottomSheet = !openBottomSheet }) {\r\n    Text(text = \"Show Bottom Sheet\")\r\n}\r\nif (openBottomSheet) {\r\n    ModalBottomSheet(\r\n        onDismissRequest = { openBottomSheet = false },\r\n        sheetState = bottomSheetState\r\n    ) {\r\n        Column(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()) {\r\n            OutlinedButton(\r\n                modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.CenterHorizontally).semantics {\r\n                    disabled()\r\n                },\r\n                // Note: If you provide logic outside of onDismissRequest to remove the sheet,\r\n                // you must additionally handle intended state cleanup, if any.\r\n                onClick = {\r\n                    scope.launch { bottomSheetState.hide() }.invokeOnCompletion {\r\n                        if (!bottomSheetState.isVisible) {\r\n                            openBottomSheet = false\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            ) {\r\n                Text(\"Hide Bottom Sheet\")\r\n            }\r\n            LazyColumn {\r\n                items(50) {\r\n                    ListItem(\r\n                        headlineContent = { Text(\"Sheet item /$it\") },\r\n                        leadingContent = {\r\n                            Icon(\r\n                                Icons.Default.Star,\r\n                                contentDescription = \"Localized description\"\r\n                            )\r\n                        }\r\n                    )\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\n```\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* **Note:** When the user has hints turned on in settings, \"double tap to activate\" will announce at the end of most interactive controls. Testing should be done with hints turned on to ensure the user understands a control is interactive by hearing either \"button\" or \"double tap to activate\" or both. Announcements on Android devices vary slightly due to manufacturer.\n* \"Sheet grabber, collapsed, double tap to activate\" (In minimized state)\n* \"Sheet grabber, expanded, double tap to activate\" (In expanded state)",

          "iosDeveloperNotes": "### General Notes\n\n* This entry describes the native app table row/list item component but does not address text-based ordered or unordered lists. Text-based ordered or unordered lists should not be identified as a defect found in native app platforms as there is not an equivalent component in the native app space.\n\n### Developer Notes\n\n* A table row/list item can be created by using different types of native components in iOS, such as iOS `List`, `Button`, `UITableView`\n* In general, a table row/list item can be a single interactive row or an interactive item within a scrolling, single-column row or list of rows. The table row/list item can contain multiple elements inside it such as text, images, icons, form inputs, buttons, etc.\n* However, a table row/list item can also be a non-interactive element as well.\n* Generally, all items in the row are grouped together, ie., the caret is not focused separately\n* If there are two interactive elements, there will be two focusable areas.\n* Often, the first focus is around the whole row, but will activate only the first interactive element\n* You should use a native component rather than custom component, because it will have the correct name, role, and values associated with it for accessibility.\n\n#### Name\n\nThe programmatic name describes the purpose of the control.\n\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.\n\n* The visible label is the programmatic name\n  * If there is a description following the visible label, it must be announced before the role.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the button's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n  * If button has icon(s), hide the icon(s) from VoiceOver by using view modifier `accessibilityHidden(true)`.\n\n#### Role\n\nWhen using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Implement a [`UITableView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitableview) which is defined as \"A view that presents data using rows in a single column.\"\n  * If `UITableView` does not fit the use case, please use a `UIButton` and style as appropriate.\n  * Set the specific `UITableViewCell` as interactive or capable of a tap gesture.\n  * If user is redirected away from the app, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.link`.\n  * If user is redirected to a screen within the app, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.button`.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Use native [`List`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/list) view, defined as \"A container that presents rows of data arranged in a single column, optionally providing the ability to select one or more members.\"\n    * If using the `List` view is not suitable for your use case, you may implement as a `Button` and stylize the component as an interactable table row. Or you may make a fully custom table row from scratch that is interactable and redirects the user to the correct destination.\n  * If user is redirected away from the app, use view modifier `accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)` to assign the role as Link.\n  * If user is redirected away from the app, use view modifier `accessibilityAddTraits(.isLink)` to assign the role as Link.\n  * If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits.\n\n#### Groupings\n\n* Group text label/ images/controls together in one swipe\n\n* Only one interactive control can be in the swipe\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n    * If frame does not exist due to custom table row, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n      * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n#### State\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`.\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the table rows to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the table row.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`\n\n#### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* Focus ring must surround the table row\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n#### Announcement examples\n\n* \"Label, button\"\n* \"Label, (plus other content in cell), button\" (grouping - all in one focusable area)\n* \"Label, button, selected\" (selected state)\n* \"Label, dimmed, button\" (disabled state)",

Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n  * If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n    * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new `accessibilityElement`.\n\n### State\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`.\n    * Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* When the date picker is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples (Contacts - date)\n\n* “Add birthday, button\" (button name and role that opens picker)\n* Often, \"collapsed or expanded\" states are added to the button that opens the picker\n* \"February, picker item, adjustable, swipe up or down with one finger to adjust the value\" (focus is on first picker item or previously selected item)\n  * Native pickers do not always show a \"Done\" button on the keyboard.

Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n    * If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n      * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views.

A title view need to used as the programmatic name.\n\n### Role\n\n* Required: Screen reader user is confined inside a modal, communicating an modal is present.\n\n#### Android Views\n\n* Android view component `AlertDialog` has the dialog role defined for using as modal\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n* Composable `AlertDialog` has default role defined\n* Composable `ModalBottomSheet` has default role defined\n\n### Groupings\n\n* If you are implementing a native app modal, do not modify native grouping logic\n* If you require a custom modal, follow the steps below.\n\n#### Android Views\n\n* `ViewGroup`\n* Set the container object's `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false. In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement.\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n* `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true) {}` for the child elements grouping/merging\n* `FocusRequester.createRefs()` helps to request focus to inner elements with in the group\n\n### State\n\n* Follow button state guidance if applicable\n* Modals that have an open/close or expands/collapses state must be announced. Add logic and announcement to the programmatic name for the state\n\n#### Android Views\n\n* Active: `android:enabled=true`\n* Disabled: `android:enabled=false`\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n* Active: default state is active and enabled. Use `Button(enabled = true)` to specify explicitly\n* Disabled: `Button(enabled = false)` announces as \"disabled\"\n* Alternatively can use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { disabled() }` to announce as \"disabled\"\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the default focus functionality of the modal\n* The screen reader focus **must** be confined within the modal. When the modal appears, the initial focus should be to a logical place or to where the default focus is for the device within the modal\n* Android initially focuses on the CTA (\"Close\" button) in the modal, not the text or title unless the close CTA is not designed at the first focus order in modal\n* Android often takes one swipe to bring focus inside the modal\n\n#### Android View\n\n* `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API\n* `android:focusable`\n* `android=clickable`\n* Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`\n* `nextFocusDown`\n* `nextFocusUp`\n* `nextFocusRight`\n* `nextFocusLeft`\n* `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)\n* To hide controls: `Important_For_Accessibility_false`\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n* `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable\n* `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with `FocusRequester` to define focus order\n* `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state\n* `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views\n* *Example:* To customize the focus events behaviour\n  * step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`\n  * step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`\n  * focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end\n  * step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus\n\n### Code Example\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n```java\n// Use AlerDialog as Modal with onDismissRequest action that enable dialog dismiss when user touch outside the dialog modal\r\nAlertDialog(\r\n    onDismissRequest = { onDismiss(true) },\r\n    title = { Text(text = \"Title\") },\r\n    text = { Text(text = \"Message\") },\r\n    confirmButton = { Button(onClick = { }) { Text(text = \"Confirm\") } },\r\n    dismissButton = { Button(onClick = { }) { Text(text = \"Cancel\") } }\r\n)\r\n// Example on using ModalBottomSheet as Modal\r\nModalBottomSheet(\r\n    onDismissRequest = { openBottomSheet = false },\r\n    sheetState = bottomSheetState,\r\n    windowInsets = windowInsets\r\n) {\r\n    Row(Modifier.fillMaxWidth(), horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.Center) {\r\n        Button(\r\n          onClick = {\r\n              scope.launch { bottomSheetState.hide() }.invokeOnCompletion {\r\n                  if (!bottomSheetState.isVisible) {\r\n                      openBottomSheet = false\r\n                  }\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n        ) {\r\n            Text(\"Close\")\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\n```\n\n### Modal announcements\n\nInitial focus area example:\n\n* Close button \"Close, button, double tap to activate\"",
          "iosDeveloperNotes": "### General Notes\n\n* Modal dialogs draw attention to an important, narrowly scoped task, usually appearing over an existing screen\n* Options to close the modal for the screen reader user:\n  * An invisible close button announced for the screen reader only\n  * A close button\n  * A Call To Action (CTA) that navigates the user and closes the modal\n* Tapping outside the modal to close **cannot** be the only option for screen reader users when the modal covers other content\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of any interactive element in the modal or the title of the modal\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognition\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* The visible label for any interactive element is the programmatic name for it.\n* If a visible label is not applicable in your case, set the modal's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n  * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n* To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n* To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* The visible label for any interactive element is the programmatic name for it\n* If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`\n\n### Role\n\n* Required: Screen reader user is confined inside the modal, communicating a modal is present\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* Set the `modalPresentationStyle` of the `UIViewController` to a `UIModalPresentationStyle` of your choice\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* Use view modifier for modal, such as `.sheet`, `.fullScreenCover`, `.popover`. Apply view modifiers to adjust the size of the modal accordingly.\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group content to minimize swipes and give context to the user\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* Since a modal is a presentation of another view, follow logical grouping and reading order within the view.\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n* If frame does not exist due to custom alert, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n  * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n* Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n* Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* Since a modal is a presentation of another view, follow logical grouping and reading order within the view.\n* Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n### State\n\n* Modals that may have an open/close or expands/collapses state must be announced. Add logic and announcement to the programmatic name for the state\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* When the modal appears, the initial focus on the Close button will imply to the user that they are in a modal.\n* For disabled content within the modal: Set the content's `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* When the modal appears, the initial focus on the Close button will imply to the user that they are in a modal.\n* For disabled content, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the default focus functionality of the modal\n* The screen reader focus **must** be confined within the alert or modal. When the modal appears, the initial focus should be to a logical place or to where the default focus is for the device within the modal.\n* Within the modal, ensure the content is following logical reading order. Follow suggested accessibility guidance for content containing buttons, links, etc.\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n  * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n* Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n* `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n* If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Modal announcements\n\nInitial focus areas:\n\n* Close button \"Close, button\" or\n* Invisible button at the top of the screen default announcement: \"Double tap to close modal\"",

For some screen reader users, identifying the graphic adds context and meaningful information\n* If the graphic is interactive to the screen reader user, consider the grouping of information and swipe order to make it understandable and logical\n* If an image does not convey meaning or is used for styling purposes, like a line separator, do not add alt text and skip it in the swipe order for the screen reader user.\n* Custom actions may be applicable in navigating a graphic\n* All interactive elements in a map or chart must be navigable by the external keyboard\n* Consider color contrast ratios between chart elements and their background as well as to each other\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control.\n\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name.

Use `Button(enabled = true)` to specify explicitly\n* Disabled: `Button(enabled = false)` announces as \"disabled\"\n* Alternatively can use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { disabled() }` to announce as \"disabled\"\n* Use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { stateDescription = \"\" }` to have a customized state announcement\n\n### Focus\n\n* Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes needs focus management\n\n#### Android Views\n\n* `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API\n* `android:focusable`\n* `android=clickable`\n* Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`\n* `nextFocusDown`\n* `nextFocusUp`\n* `nextFocusRight`\n* `nextFocusLeft`\n* `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)\n* To hide controls: `importantForAccessibility=false`\n* For a `ViewGroup`, set `screenReaderFocusable=true` and each inner object’s attribute to keyboard focus (`focusable=false`)\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n* `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable\n* `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with `FocusRequester` to define focus order\n* `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state\n* `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views\n* Example: To customize the focus events\n  * step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`\n  * step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`\n  * focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end\n  * step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* \"Important\" (Exclamation point image) (grouped with text)\n* All text is announced\n* \"Learn more, button, double tap to activate\" (Learn more CTA)",
          "iosDeveloperNotes": "* Initial screen reader focus can be on the entire tidbit and announce everything with or without a Call To Action (CTA). Or, the text and CTA can have separate focus.\n* Meaningful images should have an accessibility label\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control (if CTA is available)\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognition.\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n  * The \\_component title will overwrite the \\_component `accessibilityLabel`.\n* If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the \\_component `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n  * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n* To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n* To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`\n\n### Role\n\n* Please use guidance for the [Button control](/native-criteria/control/button) if a CTA is applicable\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with button, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the button.\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n* Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n  * If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n    * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new `accessibilityElement`\n\n### State\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n* For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\"\n  * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the \\_component to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the \\_component\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* For selected, use `accessibilityAddTraits(.isSelected)`.\n* For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n  * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n* Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n* `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n<!-- \r\nEnter information for iOS Focus using SwiftUI, update below with appropriate details\r\n--> \n\n### SwiftUI\n\n* For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n* If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* \"Important\" (Exclamation point image) (grouped with text)\n* All text is announced\n* \"Learn more, button\" (Learn more CTA)",

          "developerNotes": "## Developer Notes\n\n1. **General requirements**\n\n   The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide very specific color contrast requirements:\n\n   * Normal text (up to 18pt/24px or 14pt/18.5px if bold) must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 between the text color and background color.\n   * Large text (at least 18pt/24px or 14pt/18.5px if bold) must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the text color and background color.\n   * Meaningful graphics, user interface components and their various states, as well as focus indicators must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with the background color.\n   * **Exceptions:** Logos, incidental or decorative text and graphics, and disabled controls do not need to meet color contrast requirements.\n\n2. **How to test**\n\n   ### Automated scanning\n\n   Automated scanning tools, such as [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/), [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/), or [Deque's Axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/blog/axe-devtools-extension-update-new-color-contrast-analyzer/) are a great starting point for color contrast testing. All of these tools can run page scans that quickly generate reports identifying color contrast issues. Scans are:\n\n   * **Good** at identifying simple issues like solid colored text on solid colored backgrounds that do not meet contrast ratios.\n   * **Bad** at identifying anything more complex like text on background images, gradients, and different states for user interface components (like hover or focus) that do not meet contrast ratios.\n\n   ### Manual testing\n\n   Automated scanning must be complemented with a manual review of the page.\n\n   #### Getting started\n\n   * Open DevTools in your browser window (<span class=\"keyboard-key\">F12</span>)\n   * Right-click and select \"Inspect\" on the different color combinations that you see as you move from the top of the page on down\n   * Find the hexadecimal color values in the \"Styles\" tab of your DevTools window (see example image below)\n   * Enter the hex values into a contrast checking tool (like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) or [Deque's Color Contrast Analyzer](https://dequeuniversity.com/color-contrast)) to see if they meet contrast requirements.\n\n    <example>\r\n      <img\r\n      src=\"/media/images/how-to-test/color-contrast-hex-codes-for-contrast.png\"\r\n      alt=\"Inspecting an element in chrome to find hex codes\">\r\n    </example>\n\n   #### Hover to inspect\n\n   * Chrome has an \"Inspect Element by Mouse\" DevTools feature that is useful for checking contrast\n   * Click the button located in the upper left-hand corner of your DevTools window to enable the feature\n   * Hover over elements on the page with your cursor\n   * A popup will appear that often indicates whether the element passes contrast by displaying a green check mark within a circle (see example image below)\n\n    <example>\r\n      <img\r\n      src=\"/media/images/how-to-test/color-contrast-chrome-contrast-inspector.png\"\r\n    alt=\"using Chrome's inspect element by mouse feature to see if element meets contrast requirements\">\r\n    </example>\n\n   #### Background images and gradients\n\n   * Identify instances of text and user interface elements that sit on top of background images or color gradients\n   * Use a color picker tool to get representative hex codes from the background\n   * In Chrome's DevTools, under the \"Styles\" tab you can click on any of the color boxes to bring up the Color Picker popup\n   * Within the popup, activate the eyedropper icon\n   * Hover over the desired area on the background image with your cursor and click\n   * The hex value will be displayed in the Color Picker (see example image below)\n\n    <example>\r\n      <img\r\n    src=\"/media/images/how-to-test/color-contrast-chrome-color-picker.png\"\r\n    alt=\"using Chrome's color picker and eyedropper tool to get hex codes for background images.\">\r\n    </example>\n\n   #### State changes\n\n   * Identify interactive elements that change color based on their states, such as focus or hover\n   * Ensure that the state changes meet contrast requirements\n   * You can force some state changes to persist, which makes them easier to check\n   * Inspect the desired element\n   * In Chrome's DevTools, under the \"Styles\" tab, activate the \":hov\" toggle button\n   * Select the checkbox with desired state\n   * This will force a persistent state and allow you to check for contrast on the element (see example image below)\n\n    <example>\r\n      <img\r\n        src=\"/media/images/how-to-test/color-contrast-set-hover-state.png\"\r\n        alt=\"using Chrome's DevTools to force hover state on a link.\">\r\n    </example>\n\n   ### Browsers\n\n   * Any major browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) is acceptable for color contrast testing.\n\n3. **What to test for**\n\n    <div class=\"how-to-test-checklist-item\">\r\n      <h3>✓ Ensure text has sufficient contrast to the background color</h3>\r\n      <table class=\"column-2\">\r\n        <thead>\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <th scope=\"col\">Pass</th>\r\n            <th scope=\"col\">Fail</th>\r\n          </tr>\r\n        </thead>\r\n        <tbody>\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td><p>This text passes contrast</p></td>\r\n            <td><p style=\"color:#0FE000\">This text does NOT pass contrast</p></td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td><p style=\"color:#009999;

Keyboard and screen reader users should be able focus on each input field with their tab key, enter the relevant information, and tab away.\n\n   <example>\r\n   <label for=\"best-nato-letter\">\r\n     The best NATO letter is:\r\n   </label>\r\n   <input type=\"text\" id=\"best-nato-letter\" aria-describedby=\"best-nato-letter-hint\">\n\n   <div class=\"hint\" id=\"best-nato-letter-hint\">\r\n     Example: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie\r\n   </div>\r\n   </example>\n\n2. **Checkboxes**\n\n   Checkboxes allow users to select one or more options from a list. Keyboard and screen reader users should be able to focus on each checkbox field with their tab key and use the enter or space keys to select or unselect the item.\n\n   <example>\r\n   <fieldset>\r\n     <legend>Choose your favorite NATO letters:</legend>\n\n     <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"alphaCheckbox\">\r\n     <label for=\"alphaCheckbox\">Alpha</label>\n\n     <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"bravoCheckbox\">\r\n     <label for=\"bravoCheckbox\">Bravo</label>\n\n     <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"charlieCheckbox\" checked=\"\">\r\n     <label for=\"charlieCheckbox\">Charlie</label>\r\n   </fieldset>\r\n   </example>\n\n3. **Radio Buttons**\n\n   Radio buttons allow users to select a single option from a list. Only one radio button in a group should be be selectable at a time. Keyboard and screen reader users should be able to focus on the group of radio buttons using the tab key. Arrow keys move focus between each radio option. Options can be automatically selected as they receive focus with the arrow keys, or they can be selected using the space key. Pressing tab navigates aways from the radio group.\n\n   <example>\r\n      <fieldset>\r\n        <legend>\r\n          Choose a fruit\r\n        </legend>\r\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"fruit\" id=\"appleRadio\">\r\n        <label for=\"appleRadio\">Apple</label>\r\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"fruit\" id=\"bananaRadio\">\r\n        <label for=\"bananaRadio\">Banana</label>\r\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"fruit\" id=\"cherryRadio\" checked=\"\">\r\n        <label for=\"cherryRadio\">Cherry</label>\r\n      </fieldset>\r\n   </example>\n\n4. **Select Fields**\n\n   Select fields allow users to select one or more options from an expandable list of options. Keyboard and screen reader users should be able to focus on the select using their tab key. The space key expands the list of options, the arrow keys traverse the options, and the space or enter keys make a selection. Escape collapses the list.\n\n   <example>\r\n      <label for=\"nato\">\r\n        Select a Nato phonetic Letter\r\n      </label>\r\n      <select id=\"nato\">\r\n        <option value=\"None\" selected=\"\" disabled=\"\">Select a letter</option>\r\n        <option value=\"A\">Alpha</option>\r\n        <option value=\"B\">Bravo</option>\r\n        <option value=\"C\">Charlie</option>\r\n

These different types of images have different testing steps.\n\n   * **Informative Images:** These are visuals like pictures, photos, and illustrations that convey important information or concepts. To make them accessible, we need to include a brief description in text form that captures the key content of the image.\n\n   * **Decorative Images:** Sometimes, images are used purely for aesthetic purposes and don't convey meaningful information. In such cases, it's best to provide an empty text alternative `alt=\"\"` to indicate that the image serves a decorative role and doesn't require a description.\n\n   * **Functional Images:** Images that serve as links or buttons should have text alternatives that describe their function rather than just their appearance. For example, if you have an image of a printer icon that initiates a printing action, the alt text should convey this functionality, like \"Print.\"\n\n   * **Images of Text:** Images of text should be avoided whenever possible. In fact, some images of text can violate [WCAG 1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/images-of-text.html). However, if you must use images with text, ensure that the alt text contains the exact same words as the text within the image to maintain consistency.\n\n   * **Complex Images such as Graphs and Diagrams:** When using images to present complex data or detailed information, it's crucial to provide a comprehensive text description that conveys all the data and details found in the image. This allows individuals who cannot see the image to still access and understand its content.\n\n2. **How to test**\n\n   ### Automated Testing\n\n   Automated scanning tools, such as [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/), [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/), or [Deque's Axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/blog/axe-devtools-extension-update-new-color-contrast-analyzer/) are a great starting point for image testing. All of these tools can run page scans that quickly generate reports identifying some image issues. Scans are:\n\n   * <strong>Good</strong> at identifying simple issues like missing <code>alt</code> attributes on images or empty alt attributes on functional images.\n   * <strong>Bad</strong> at identifying issues related to alternative text quality or whether or not an image should be marked as decorative and hidden from screen readers.\n\n   ### Manual testing\n\n   Automated scanning must be complemented with a manual review of the page. Manual image testing can test for alt text quality, ensuring that decorative images are hidden from assistive technology, all text found in images of text are present in alt text, and that functional images have the appropriate alt text.\n\n   #### <strong>Getting started</strong>\n\n   * Open Chrome DevTools in your browser window <span class=\"keyboard-key\">F12</span>\n   * Right-click and select \"Inspect\" on the image in the page you want to test.\n\n3. **Informative Images**\n\n   * Check that the image owns an <code>alt</code> attribute.\n   * Ensure that the <code>alt</code> attribute is present is not empty.\n   * Ensure that the alt attribute is present is not empty, such as <code>alt</code> or <code>alt=\"\"</code>\n   * The <code>alt</code> attribute value / description of the image should be accurate and succinct. The image alternative should not consist of information that duplicates nearby text content.\n\n   <img\r\n   src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-images-meaningful-1.png\"\r\n   alt=\"Inspecting an image in DevTools to check alt text, meaningful image\"/>\n\n   ### IMG\n\n   ```html\n   <img alt=\"A rear view of the iPhone 15 Pro in silver, along with a front view of the iPhone 15 Pro Max in silver.\" src=\"../iphone.png\" ... >\n   ```\n\n   ### SVG\n\n   Some images are implemented using inline <code>SVG</code>. Text alernatives for these images can be defined by use of <code>role=\"img\"</code> and <code>aria-label=\"I am the alt text\"</code>. The <code>alt</code> attribute should not be on an element whose <code>role</code> is <code>role=\"img\"</code> this is instead handled by <code>aria-label</code>.\n\n   ```html\n   <svg role=\"img\" aria-label=\"I am the alt text\">...</svg>\n   ```\n\n4. **Decorative Images**\n\n   * Ensure that the <code>alt</code> attribute is present and owns an empty or null value. <code>alt=\"\"</code>.\n   * <strong>Note:</strong> <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code> is not needed if an image has an empty or null alt attribute value <code>alt=\"\"</code>.\n\n    <img src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-images-decorative-1.png\" alt=\"Inspecting an image in DevTools to check alt text, decorative image\">\n\n   ```html\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"../some-image.png\" ...>\n   ```\n\n5. **Functional Images**\n\n   * Ensure the <code>alt</code> attribute is present and owns a value that includes <strong>all</strong> of the text found in the image.\n   * Functional images are typically links or buttons so the alt text should define the purpose of the link instead of describing the image.\n\n    <img src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-images-functional.png\" alt=\"Inspecting an image in DevTools to check alt text, functional image\">\n\n   * **Note:** Functional images can have empty or null alt attribute values <code>alt=\"\"</code> if the text alternative is conveyed in the parent control's label. For example, <code>aria-label=\"Download on the Apple App Store\"</code>.\n\n   ```html\n   <button aria-label=\"Download on the Apple App Store\">\r\n       <img src=\"apple.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n   </button>\n   ```\n\n6. **Images of Text**\n\n   * Sometimes text can't be easily created with HTML and CSS and an image must contain text. In this case, ensure the <code>alt</code> attribute is present and owns a value that includes <strong>all</strong> of the text found in the image.\n   * Typically, the text is the most important part of the image. There is no need for the image itself to be described unless it adds value to the content of the page.\n   * Consider logging a defect for [WCAG 1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/images-of-text.html) if it seems like there might be a viable workaround to add real text to the page vs. an image of text.\n\n    <img src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-test-images-text.png\" alt=\"Inspecting an image in DevTools to check alt text, image of text example\">\n\n   ```html\n   <img src=\"apple-iphone-15-pro.png\" alt=\"Titanium Apple iPhone 15 Pro\">\n   ```\n\n7. **Complex Images**\n\n   * Data visualizations, charts, and graphs can be very difficult to author alternative text for. Some features like charts and graphs may not be accessible themselves but there can be text alternatives nearby that can act as an accessible alternative.\n   * For complex images that are <code>img</code> elements, ensure that the image has an <code>alt</code> attribute and that its value communicates the general purpose of the image. This alt text does not need to contain all of the visual information as that may be too long for an appropriate alt text value. If the alt text does not describe all content in the image ensure there is content nearby, or linked to, that does contain all of the visual information in text form.\n   * For charts and graphs, these features are typically not 100% accessible. Ensure there is content nearby, or linked to, that does contain all of the visual information in text form. For example, an accessible Excel download or HTML Table presenting the key visual information from the content found in the chart.\n   * <strong>Note:</strong> It is important that all text alternatives to complex images must be in an accessible format to qualify as an accessible alternative.\n\n    <img src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-test-images-complex-data.png\" alt=\"Complex chart with nearby HTML table for text alternative\">\n\n   ```html\n   <img src=\"/assets/images/examples/how-to-test-images-complex-data.png\" alt=\"Complex chart with nearby HTML table for text alternative\">\r\n\r\n   <table>\r\n       <caption>NASDAQ: TMUS</caption>\r\n       <tr>\r\n       <th>Date</th>\r\n       <th>Price</th>\r\n       <!-- ... -->\r\n       </tr>\r\n       <tr>\r\n       <td>January 10</td>\r\n       <td>122.20</td>\r\n       <!-- ... -->\r\n       </tr>\r\n   </table>\n   ```\n\n8. **What to test for**\n\n    <div class=\"how-to-test-checklist-item\">\r\n    <h3>✓ Ensure meaningful images have alt text</h3>\r\n    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The passing example has alt text that matches the text found in the image.

For example, buttons and links. |\n   | Shift + Tab | Moves in reverse through the interface focusing on elements that are focusable.                      |\n   | Enter       | Active links and buttons.                                                                            |\n   | Spacebar    | Activates buttons and interacts with form elements.                                                  |\n   | Escape      | Should close or dismiss widgets like dialogs.                                                        |\n\n3. **What to test for**\n\n   ✓ **Ensure all mouse functionality is present for keyboard**\n\n   Identify functionality within the experience that can be operated with a mouse or pointing device. Ensure this content can be accessed with they keyboard alone.\n\n   ✓ **Ensure there is a highly visible visual indication of keyboard focus**\n\n   Keyboard users need to understand where they are in the interface at all times. The visual indication of keyboard focus (focus ring) should be highly visible and have a color contrast ratio of 3:1 against the background. Verify that overlap items (e.g. cookie banners, sticky footers, sticky headers, and non-modal dialogs) do not obscure the visual indicator.\n\n   ✓ **Ensure that there are no keyboard traps**\n\n   Ensure that while navigating the experience, you do not encounter situations where you are not able to move forward or backward with the keyboard alone.\n\n   ✓ **Verify that the focus order is logical**\n\n   In an English-based experience, keyboard focus should move top-to-bottom and left-to-right in a logical order. Ensure focus is not jumping around the experience in a way that makes it hard to understand the content.\n\n   ✓ **On focus does not create a change of context**\n\n   Ensure that when an interactive element receives keyboard focus that a change of context is not initiated without warning of such behavoir. An example of change of context is a page load or web form submission.\n\n   ✓ **Test for skip links**\n\n   Where there are large chunks of repeated content, ensure that there are skip links present for keboard users. For example, on a site with a large site navigation system, the first focusable element in the page should be a link that allows users to jump to the main content of the site.\n\n### Video Example\n\n<video controls>\r\n  <source src=\"media/video/how-to-test/how-to-keyboard.webm\" type=\"video/webm\">\r\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\r\n</video>\n\n## Related WCAG\n\n* 1.4.11: Non-text Contrast\n* 2.1.1 Keyboard\n* 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap\n* 2.4.3 Focus Order\n* 2.4.7 Focus Visible\n* 3.2.1 On Focus\n\n## Resources\n\n[WebAIM: Keyboard Accessibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/)"

This includes people who are blind, deaf, have low vision, or have mobility impairments.\n\nTo thoroughly test web accessibility, a combination of manual and automated testing methods are performed against the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Level A and AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). Manual testing involves people navigating the site, using assistive technologies like screen readers or keyboard-only navigation, and verifying if all content is perceivable, operable, understandable. Automated testing utilizes specialized tools to scan for common accessibility issues, such as missing alternative text for images or improper heading structure.\n\nBy combining both approaches, we can identify and address accessibility barriers comprehensively, improving the overall user experience and inclusivity of our digital products.\n\n1. ## Test against MagentaA11y.com\n\n   A good first step is to test against MagentaA11y.com patterns. Each pattern includes a How to Test section, code samples, notes about expected functionality, and clear acceptance criteria.\n\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion\">\r\n      <h2 class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__heading\">\r\n      <button\r\n        class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline\"\r\n        aria-expanded=\"false\"\r\n        data-fn=\"toggleAccordionState\"\r\n        aria-controls=\"list\">\r\n        <span class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline--text\">Example: Toggle Switch</span>\r\n      </button>\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__body\" id=\"list\">\r\n      <h3>Scenario</h3>\r\n      On the web page you are testing you encounter a toggle switch that does not work with the left and right arrow keys like you believe it should.\n\n      <h3>What to do</h3>\r\n      To verify if arrow key support is expected for toggles on the web, you can first check MagentaA11y. Locate the <a href=\"https://www.magentaa11y.com/#/web-criteria/component/toggle-switch\">Toggle Switch</a> component page and review the How to test section. Arrow key support is not mentioned so this is not a requirement for toggle Switch components and so this is not an accessibility issue. \r\n      </div>\r\n      </div>\n\n2. ## Design System\n\n   If you are testing an experience that is created from a formal design system, you can reference that design system’s documentation. Design systems will provide functional components and detailed information on how components should be implemented and function.\n\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion\">\r\n      <h2 class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__heading\">\r\n      <button\r\n        class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline\"\r\n        aria-expanded=\"false\"\r\n        data-fn=\"toggleAccordionState\"\r\n        aria-controls=\"list\">\r\n        <span class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline--text\">Example: Interactive Table</span>\r\n      </button>\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__body\" id=\"list\">\r\n      <h3>Scenario</h3>\r\n      You are testing a page that consists of an interactive table. When you send keyboard focus to the table, focus skips the table headers and jumps to the second row. You are not sure if this is a focus order issue.\n\n      <h3>What to do</h3>\r\n      You know this project uses the brand-new design system, so you check the documentation for the interactive table. You learn that the table is implemented as an ARIA Grid and learn that this is the expected behavior, so this is not an accessibility issue. \r\n      </div>\r\n      </div>\n\n3. ## Automated testing\n\n   Often, accessibility barriers are related to code issues. Automated testing can quickly detect code-related issues that may create barriers for assistive technology users.\n\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion\">\r\n      <h2 class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__heading\">\r\n      <button\r\n        class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline\"\r\n        aria-expanded=\"false\"\r\n        data-fn=\"toggleAccordionState\"\r\n        aria-controls=\"list\">\r\n        <span class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline--text\">Example: Nested Buttons</span>\r\n      </button>\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__body\" id=\"list\">\r\n      <h3>Scenario</h3>\r\n      You are testing a button that when activated, presents a list of options. For some reason, the screen reader will not interact with the button correctly. \n\n      <h3>What to do</h3>\r\n      You have ran some automated accessibility tests and in the results there is an issue identified that indicates the author has nested a button element inside of another button element and that is not only invalid HTML, it is creating the barrier with the screen reader so this is an issue.\n\n   ```html\n   <div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">\r\n     <button>Click Me</button>\r\n   </div>\n   ```\n\n      </div>\r\n      </div>\n\n4. ## Code Inspection\n\n   Automated testing does not catch everything. You can have code that is “correct” or valid and it can still create accessibility issues. Manual inpsection of code can often identify what the issue is.\n\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion\">\r\n      <h2 class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__heading\">\r\n      <button\r\n        class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline\"\r\n        aria-expanded=\"false\"\r\n        data-fn=\"toggleAccordionState\"\r\n        aria-controls=\"list\">\r\n        <span class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline--text\">Example: Nested Dialogs</span>\r\n      </button>\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__body\" id=\"list\">\r\n      <h3>Scenario</h3>\r\n      On the web page you are testing you encounter a dialog that is not being announced by the NVDA screen reader for some reason.\n\n      <h3>What to do</h3>\r\n      After opening Chrome DevTools and inspecting the code, you notice higher up in the DOM that there is a dialog element nested inside of another dialog element. While this may be valid HTML, it has created a barrier for NVDA users because it is not a standard implementation of a dialog, so this is an accessibility issue.\r\n      </div>\r\n      </div>\n\n5. ## HTML Validation\n\n   Code validity and proper use of HTML is an important factor with accessibility. You can use the Nu Html Checker to validate code. You can also reference the HTML Living Standard for guidelines on proper HTML use.\n\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion\">\r\n      <h2 class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__heading\">\r\n      <button\r\n        class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline\"\r\n        aria-expanded=\"false\"\r\n        data-fn=\"toggleAccordionState\"\r\n        aria-controls=\"list\">\r\n        <span class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline--text\">Example: Label not announced</span>\r\n      </button>\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__body\" id=\"list\">\r\n      <h3>Scenario</h3>\r\n      An ARIA Combobox has a nearby text label, but this label is not announced by the screen reader when the widget receives focus. \n\n      <h3>What to do</h3>\r\n      Using the Nu Html Checker, validate an isolated fragment of code to see if there are any code validity issues. Improper use of HTML or even spelling errors can cause accessibility barriers. For example, <code>aria-labeledby</code> is misspelled and should be <code>aria-labelledby</code>. Code validation would detect this code issue. \r\n      </div>\r\n      </div>\n\n6. ## Verify you are correctly using the screen reader or keyboard\n\n      <!-- TODO: When the folder structure for \"how to test\" is updated, these two links will need to be updated -->\n\n   Before you log an issue, make sure that you have tested it correctly. Refer to the MagentaAlly sections on How to test [Keyboard & focus](/how-to-test-criteria/type/keyboard-&-focus) and [Screen readers](/how-to-test-criteria/type/screen-readers) for guidance on system settings and methodology.\n\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion\">\r\n      <h2 class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__heading\">\r\n      <button\r\n        class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline\"\r\n        aria-expanded=\"false\"\r\n        data-fn=\"toggleAccordionState\"\r\n        aria-controls=\"list\">\r\n        <span class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline--text\">Example: Unable to navigate with Tab</span>\r\n      </button>\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__body\" id=\"list\">\r\n      <h3>Scenario</h3>\r\n      You are attempting to test a web page on your Mac with your keyboard, but are unable to focus on elements you think should be focusable with the Tab Key.\n\n      <h3>What to do</h3>\r\n      On your MacOS, you go into the \"Keyboard\" section of your \"System Settings\" and see that \"Keyboard navigation\" has not been turned on. Once you turn it on, you are able to tab through the page as expected so this is not an issue. \r\n      </div>\r\n      </div>\n\n7. ## Verify with other screen reader and browser combinations\n\n   Sometimes there are bugs that exist with different screen reader and browser combinations, so it is important to test with several browsers and, ideally, different screen readers.\n\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion\">\r\n      <h2 class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__heading\">\r\n      <button\r\n        class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline\"\r\n        aria-expanded=\"false\"\r\n        data-fn=\"toggleAccordionState\"\r\n        aria-controls=\"list\">\r\n        <span class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline--text\">Example: Accordion not annoucing as expanded</span>\r\n      </button>\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__body\" id=\"list\">\r\n      <h3>Scenario</h3>\r\n      You are testing a page in Chrome with NVDA. On page load there is an expanded accordion button, but it is not annoucing as expanded with NVDA.\n\n      <h3>What to do</h3>\r\n      You inspect the code and see the appropriate <code>aria-expanded=\"true\"</code> attribute, so you test the same page in Firefox with NVDA and JAWS, as well as in Safari with VoiceOver. The button is announcing as expected in all environments so you determine there is a bug with NVDA/Chrome and do not need to mark it as an accessibility issue. \r\n      </div>\r\n      </div>\n\n8. ## Document the accessibility issue\n\n   Make it easy for others to review and fix your issue.\n\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion\">\r\n      <h2 class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__heading\">\r\n      <button\r\n        class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline\"\r\n        aria-expanded=\"false\"\r\n        data-fn=\"toggleAccordionState\"\r\n        aria-controls=\"list\">\r\n        <span class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline--text\">Example: Image not announcing</span>\r\n      </button>\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__body\" id=\"list\">\r\n      <h3>Scenario</h3>\r\n      You discovered an image of a product that is not announcing for screen readers on the home page because it is missing an <code>alt</code> attribute.\n\n      <h3>What to do</h3>\r\n      You want to clearly capture the exact steps to recreate the issue in your organizations bug tracking system:\n\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>The URL where the image is located</li>\r\n        <li>A description of the image and its location on the page</li>\r\n        <li>The accessibility concern (ex: \"missing <code>alt</code> attribute\")</li>\r\n        <li>Who it impacts - which users are impacted by the barrier and why</li>\r\n        <li>A snippet of the corresponding code</li>\r\n        <li>Screenshots of the images (ensure the screenshot has context - don't crop too tight)</li>\r\n        <li>A good/fixed snippet of the corresponding code</li>\r\n      </ul>\n\n   While it is always helpful to provide screenshots, your issue should be written clear enough that they are not needed by someone reading the details of the bug.\n\n      </div>\r\n      </div>"
