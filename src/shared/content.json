The method returns a `MediaQueryList` object that can be used to check for the user's preference for reduced motion.\n\n```javascript\nconst isReduced = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches;\n\nif (isReduced) {\n   // The user has requested reduced motion\n} else {\n   // The user has not requested reduced motion\n}\n```\n\n## Further Reading\n\n* [MDN - matchMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia)\n* [MDN - prefers-reduced-motion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@media/prefers-reduced-motion)\n* [WCAG 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/timing-adjustable)\n* [WCAG 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html)\n* [WCAG 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold)\n* [WCAG 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions (Level AAA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html)"

          "developerNotes": "## Our General Advice\n\nThink carefully before you use a carousel, slideshow, or multi-slide component. Consider another way to present the information.\n\n### Carousels go against many usability and accessibility best practices\n\nWherever possible, do not use carousels. Consider whether you can present content in another way, such as a list.\n\nCarousels are complex components that are hard to make accessible, and by their nature, go against many usability and accessibility best practices, such as:\n\n* Auto-advancing carousels are never allowed as it will violate [WCAG 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html). Additionally, auto-advancing can be incredibly distracting for many users, and can be disruptive for screen reader users.\n* Carousels are a visual-first design that is complex to relay to screen readers the proper structure and information architecture.\n* Studies have shown that most people do not interact with carousels, or advance any slides. (Source: [Norman Nielsen article](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/designing-effective-carousels/))\n\n### Alternatives to Carousels\n\nSome alternative components to a Carousel to consider are:\n\n* A multi-step form\n  * This can work because it helps people stay on task.\n* A list of easily recognizable structure, like \"US Presidents\"\n  * This can work because the scope and contents are predictable.\n* Highlighted customer reviews\n  * This can work to build trust because the contents are predictable and a motivated user seeking social proof may be willing to navigate the carousel.\n\n## Code examples\n\n### Use semantic HTML\n\nThis is one example of an accessible carousel that uses HTML semantics and ARIA:\n\n* The carousel is grouped and has a name\n* The ordered list structure provides context for how many slides and which number slide someone is on.\n* No focus management is happening. We have chosen to NOT move a user from the next/previous buttons and allow them to browse at their own pace.\n* This example does not make use of a live announcing region, but in some cases, that may be helpful.\n\n```html\n<h2 id=\"headingCarousel\">Phones available</h2>\n<section id=\"carousel\" aria-label=\"Carousel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingCarousel carousel\" class=\"carousel\">\n\n  <div class=\"flex\">\n      <div>\n         <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary button-control button-control--left\">\n            <span aria-hidden=\"true\">&lt;&lt;</span>\n            <span class=\"hidden-visually\">Previous 3 slides</span>\n         </button>\n         <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary button-control button-control--right\">\n            <span aria-hidden=\"true\">&gt;&gt;</span>\n            <span class=\"hidden-visually\">Next 3 slides</span>\n         </button>\n      </div>\n    <ol class=\"list\" role=\"list\"> \n<!--  Need role=\"list\" because of weird Voiceover bug: https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/01/12/lists-and-safari.html      -->\n      <li>\n         <img \n                           src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591337676887-a217a6970a8a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTR8fGlwaG9uZXxlbnwwfHwwfHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=60\" \n                           alt=\"iPhone 14\" />\n      </li>\n      <li>\n         <img \n                           src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583574333311-3a86605c76b2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2068&q=80\" \n                           alt=\"Samsung Galaxy phone\" />\n      </li>\n      <li>\n         <img \n                           src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1612442443556-09b5b309e637?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1740&q=80\" \n                           alt=\"Google Pixel phone\" />\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </div>\n</section>\n```\n\n<example>\n   <h2 id=\"headingCarousel\">Phones available</h2>\n   <section id=\"carousel\" aria-label=\"Carousel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingCarousel carousel\" class=\"carousel\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n         <div class=\"button-container\">\n            <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary button-control button-control--left\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\">&lt;&lt;</span>\n               <span class=\"hidden-visually\">Previous 3 slides</span>\n            </button>\n            <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary button-control button-control--right\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\">&gt;&gt;</span>\n               <span class=\"hidden-visually\">Next 3 slides</span>\n            </button>\n         </div>\n         <ol class=\"list\" role=\"list\"> \n      <!--  Need role=\"list\" because of weird Voiceover bug: https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/01/12/lists-and-safari.html      -->\n            <li><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591337676887-a217a6970a8a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTR8fGlwaG9uZXxlbnwwfHwwfHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=60\" alt=\"iPhone 14\" /></li>\n            <li><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583574333311-3a86605c76b2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2068&q=80\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy phone\" /></li>\n            <li><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1612442443556-09b5b309e637?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1740&q=80\" alt=\"Google Pixel phone\" /></li>\n         </ol>\n      </div>\n   </section>\n</example>\n\n## Related WCAG\n\n* [WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships)\n* [WCAG 1.4.10 Reflow (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow.html)\n* [WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard.html)\n* [WCAG 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html)\n* [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value)"

A (currently) reliable method is to keep interactive elements outside the label and reference it with `aria-describedby=\"hint-id\"`\n\n```html\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Legal disclaimers</legend>\n

using `aria-disabled=\"true` will be focusable with the tab key\n* Use JS to `preventDefault()`\n\n```html\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Choose your favorite fruit</legend>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"lemonsCheckbox\" aria-disabled=\"true\" checked>\n  <label for=\"lemonsCheckbox\">Lemons</label>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"limesCheckbox\" aria-disabled=\"true\">\n  <label

for=\"limesCheckbox\">Limes</label>\n\n</fieldset>\n</example>\n\n### Fully disabled checkbox\n\n* An input using the `disabled` attribute will not be focusable with the tab key\n* Arrow keys will still be able to browse disabled inputs\n\n```html\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Choose your favorite video game</legend>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"marioCheckbox\" disabled checked>\n  <label

Speciality checkboxes\n\nSometimes a design may call for a card-type checkbox.\n\n* Its core should still be a semantic checkbox input\n* Use `aria-describedby` to read extra content *after* the the name, role, and state\n\n```html\n<ul class=\"cards\">\n  <li class=\"card interactive\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\"\n           id=\"oscarCheckboxCard\"\n

can also be used (as a last resort)\n\n### Role\n\n* **By default**, semantic HTML checkbox inputs identify as a checkbox\n* Use `role=\"checkbox\"` for custom elements\n\n### Group\n\n* Semantic HTML\n  * `<fieldset>` wraps a checkbox group\n  * `<legend>` describes the group's purpose\n  * Each `<label>` must include `for=\"input-id\"` to be associated with its input\n* Custom elements\n  * Use `role=\"group\"` in the place of fieldset\n  * Use `aria-labelledby=\"label-id\"` to associate an element as a label\n  * `aria-label=\"Group purpose\"` can also be used if there's no label with an `id`\n\n### State\n\n* Semantic HTML\n  * Use `checked` for native HTML\n  * Use the `disabled` state for inactive checkboxes\n* Custom element\n  * Use `aria-checked=\"true/false\"` to express state\n  * Use `aria-disabled=\"true\"` to declare inactive elements\n\n### Focus\n\n* Focus must be visible\n* Custom elements will require keyboard event listeners"

These types of images are generally included for purely stylistic purposes and don't impart any meaning to the rest of the content on the page.\n\n## Is this image decorative or informative?\n\nIf the image conveys important meaning, and there's no other text on the page which explains the concept within it, then the image is likely informative. In this case, check out the <a href=\"https://www.magentaa11y.com/#/web-criteria/component/informative-image\">informative image checklist</a> item instead.\n\n## Decorative images still require an alt attribute\n\n* To have valid HTML, the `alt` attribute must still be present, even when set to the empty empty value of `alt`. Note that `alt` and `alt=\"\"` (no space) are equivalent in HTML.\n  * When the `alt` attribute is empty, the screen reader ignores it (and will not read anything).\n  * When the `alt` attribute is missing, the screen reader will read the `src` name or filename of the image which is a very poor user experience.\n\n<example class=\"example example--contains-icon\">\n  <h3 class=\"h-charlie decorated\">\n    <img src=\"media/images/icons/icon-info.svg\" alt=\"\"> \n    Note: Your plan might be changing soon.\n  </h3>\n  <a href=\"tel:8888888888\" className=\"decorated\">\n    <img src=\"media/images/icons/icon-phone.svg\" class=\"icon\" alt=\"\">\n      Call us: 888-888-8888\n  </a>\n</example>\n\n```html\n<h3 class=\"h-charlie decorated\">\n  <img\n    src=\"media/images/icons/icon-info.svg\"\n    class=\"icon\"\n    alt=\"\" />\n  Note: Your plan might be changing soon.\n</h3>\n<a \n  href=\"tel:8888888888\"\n  class=\"decorated\">\n  <img \n    src=\"media/images/icons/icon-phone.svg\"\n    class=\"icon\"\n    alt=\"\" />\n    Call us: 888-888-8888\n</a>\n```\n\n## Using inline SVG\n\n### Inline SVG that is decorative\n\nInline SVGs require some special code to be hidden properly from screen readers:\n\n* `aria-hidden=\"true\"`\n\nIf you are using a `<use />` element, add `aria-hidden=\"true\"`.\n\n```html\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\">\n  <use href=\"#svg-id\" aria-hidden=\"true\" />\n  <!-- if not using <use> then the child elements \n       of the inline SVG would go here -->\n</svg>\n```\n\n## Further reading\n\n* This page owes a lot to this exhaustive blog post: [Contextually Marking up accessible images and SVGs by Scott O'Hara](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/05/22/contextual-images-svgs-and-a11y.html)\n* [W3C Image decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/)"

We recommend the use of an ARIA Disclosure Widget which has very robust support.\n\n```html\n<details>\n  <summary>\n    About Sesame Street\n  </summary>\n    Sesame Street is an American educational \n    children's television series that combines \n    live-action, sketch comedy, animation, and puppetry.\n</details>\n```\n\n<example>\n   <details>\n      <summary>\n         About Sesame Street\n      </summary>\n         Sesame Street is an American educational \n         children's television series that combines \n         live-action, sketch comedy, animation, and puppetry.\n   </details>\n</example>\n\n## Developer notes\n\n### Name\n\n* Inner text must describe the purpose.\n\n### Role\n\n* Native button identifies as button by default.\n* If using custom elements, use `role=\"button\"` and `tabindex=\"0\"`.\n\n### Group\n\n* You *can* use `aria-controls=\"popupId\"`, but it is not well supported.\n\n### State\n\n* Expander accordions use `aria-expanded` which toggles between \"true\" and \"false\" when the content is expanded or collapsed.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Focus must be visible.\n\n## Design notes\n\n* [Nielsen Norman Group study](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accordion-icons/): The caret icon most clearly indicated to users that it would open an accordion in place, rather than linking directly to a new page.\n* Not all users will notice there is hidden content or understand how these work.

If the image is included for purely stylistic purposes and doesn't impart any meaning to the rest of the content on the page, then the image is likely decorative.

This attribute has very low and support and unpredictable output across screen readers.\n\n## Name\n\n* The modal window has a logical descriptive name from either:\n  * `aria-label=\"Modal title\"` or\n  * `aria-labelledby=\"heading-id\"` pointing to an `<h2>` as a title\n\n### Role\n\n* Use `role=\"dialog\"` so the screen reader can identify this as a dialog or modal.\n\n### Group\n\n* Upon closing, focus must return to the button that launched the dialog.\n\n### State\n\n* Use `aria-modal=\"true\"` to indicate content beneath the modal is inert and that the screen reader must not browse outside the dialog.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use `tabindex=\"-1\"` to make the modal itself targetable for focus.\n* Upon closing, focus must return to the button that launched the dialog.\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [Browser Support](https://caniuse.com/?search=dialog)\n\n## Screenreader differences\n\n### NVDA\n\n* By default, NVDA may read the entire modal upon launch. This is expected behavior.\n\n## Code examples\n\n### Use semantic HTML where possible\n\nSince browser support for `<dialog>` is incomplete, if you plan to use the `<dialog>` element we recommend that you include the `role=\"dialog\"` attribute because the element alone is not fully compatible.\n\nSome browsers require additional scripting. This simple example works in Chrome, but [may not work correctly in all browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=dialog) such as Safari and Firefox.\n\n```html\n   <button id=\"showModal\">\n   Things you should know\n   </button>\n\n   <dialog role=\"dialog\"\n         id=\"modal\"\n         tabindex=\"-1\"\n         aria-modal=\"true\"\n         aria-labelledby=\"dialog-title\">\n   <button type=\"button\"\n            id=\"closeModal\"\n            class=\"close\">\n      <span class=\"hidden\">Close</span>\n   </button>\n   <div class=\"dialog-content\">\n      <h2 id=\"dialog-title\" class=\"h-bravo\">\n         Things you should know\n      </h2>\n      <h3>Keyboard</h3>\n      <ul>\n         <li>Focus must not enter the rest of the page.</li>\n         <li>The escape key must close the modal.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Screenreader</h3>\n      <ul>\n         <li>The modal's title is announced on launch.</li>\n         <li>The screen reader cannot read content behind the dialog.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <button type=\"submit\">\n         Continue\n      </button>\n   </section>\n   </dialog>\n```\n\n<!-- TODO: The code sample example is not currently functional - fix needed.\n\n<example>\n   <button id=\"showModal\">\n   Things you should know\n   </button>\n\n   <dialog role=\"dialog\"\n         id=\"modal\"\n         tabindex=\"-1\"\n         aria-modal=\"true\"\n         aria-labelledby=\"dialog-title\">\n   <button type=\"button\"\n            id=\"closeModal\"\n            class=\"close\">\n      <span class=\"hidden\">Close</span>\n   </button>\n   <div class=\"dialog-content\">\n      <h2 id=\"dialog-title\" class=\"h-bravo\">\n         Things you should know\n      </h2>\n      <h3>Keyboard</h3>\n      <ul>\n         <li>Focus must not enter the rest of the page.</li>\n         <li>The escape key must close the modal.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Screenreader</h3>\n      <ul>\n         <li>The modal's title is announced on launch.</li>\n         <li>The screen reader cannot read content behind the dialog.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <button type=\"submit\">\n         Continue\n      </button>\n   </section>\n   </dialog>\n</example> -->\n\n## Further Reading\n\n* [WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html)\n* [WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard)\n* [WCAG 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-order.html)\n* [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value)"

For example, “Password is currently visible”.\n  * Avoid adding `aria-hidden=\"true\"` or CSS `display: none;` to the live region container that receives the dynamic update as this may impact screen reader support.\n  * Ensure the dynamic text, that is added to the live region, is removed from the DOM after a short amount of time so screen reader users do not encounter this text while navigating

It's recommended to add full ARIA attributes, even when using a `<progress>` element.\n\n### Use semantic HTML\n\n* This semantic HTML contains all accessibility features by default.\n* While not a requirement, it is focusable to increase discoverability.\n\n```html\n<progress role=\"progressbar\"\n          id=\"progress\"\n          tabindex=\"0\"\n          class=\"progress\"\n          aria-label=\"File upload\"\n          value=\"50\"\n          aria-valuemin=\"0\"\n          aria-valuenow=\"50\"\n          aria-valuemax=\"100\"\n          max=\"100\">\n```\n\n<example>\n<progress role=\"progressbar\"\n          id=\"progress\"\n          tabindex=\"0\"\n          class=\"progress\"\n          aria-label=\"File upload\"\n          value=\"50\"\n          aria-valuemin=\"0\"\n          aria-valuenow=\"50\"\n          aria-valuemax=\"100\"\n          max=\"100\">\n</example>\n\n### Spinner loading takeover\n\n* There are many variations of loaders and spinners.\n* While a takeover spinner modal is present, other content on the page must be inert.\n\n#### Use semantic HTML\n\n* This semantic HTML contains all accessibility features using a dialog.\n  * The `<progress>` element can be used to describe the state.\n\n#### Ensure content is ready before being available\n\n* If content is being loaded slowly behind the spinner inside an `aria-live` region, use `aria-busy=\"true\"` to keep it from being announced until the update is complete.\n\n```html\n<!-- Use aria-busy if content doesn't all load at once -->\n<div id=\"really-slow-app\" \n     aria-live=\"polite\" \n     aria-busy=\"false\">\n     \n  <button id=\"showModal\">\n    Launch spinner\n  </button>\n\n  <dialog role=\"dialog\"\n          class=\"takeover\"\n          id=\"modal\"\n          tabindex=\"-1\"\n          aria-modal=\"true\"\n          aria-labelledby=\"modal-title\">\n    <section>\n      <div class=\"progress-spinner\">\n        <progress role=\"progressbar\" \n                  id=\"modal-title\" \n                  tabindex=\"0\" \n                  aria-label=\"Loading\">\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  </dialog>\n</div>\n```\n\n<!-- TODO: the button should open this modal - should we add text in the loading modal that says you can use your ESCAPE key to close the modal for those who are unfamiliar?\n\n<example>\n<!-- Use aria-busy if content doesn't all load at once\n<div id=\"really-slow-app\" \n     aria-live=\"polite\" \n     aria-busy=\"false\">\n     \n  <button id=\"showModal\">\n    Launch spinner\n  </button>\n\n  <dialog role=\"dialog\"\n          class=\"takeover\"\n          id=\"modal\"\n          tabindex=\"-1\"\n          aria-modal=\"true\"\n          aria-labelledby=\"modal-title\">\n    <section>\n      <div class=\"progress-spinner\">\n        <progress role=\"progressbar\" \n                  id=\"modal-title\" \n                  tabindex=\"0\" \n                  aria-label=\"Loading\">\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  </dialog>\n</div>\n</example> -->\n\n### Inline dynamic loading waiting example\n\nThis example dynamically injects progress updates that will be read by a screen reader:\n\n* `aria-busy=\"true\"` indicates that the region is busy\n* `aria-describedby` allows the current progress to be read when the button is focused\n* `aria-disabled` reinforces that the save action is incomplete\n* `role=\"status\"` has an implicit `aria-live=\"polite\"` and `aria-atomic=\"true\"`, meaning the entire content of the status will be read on each update\n\n```html\n<div \n  id=\"slow-app\"\n  aria-live=\"polite\">\n  \n  <button \n    id=\"trigger-progressbar\"\n    aria-describedby=\"progress-busy\"\n    aria-disabled=\"false\">\n      Save\n  </button>\n\n  <div class=\"progress-busy inert\" role=\"status\">\n    <span id=\"progress-busy\">\n    </span> \n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n<!-- TODO: demo doesn't currently work\n\n<example>\n<div \n  id=\"slow-app\"\n  aria-live=\"polite\">\n  \n  <button \n    id=\"trigger-progressbar\"\n    aria-describedby=\"progress-busy\"\n    aria-disabled=\"false\">\n      Save\n  </button>\n\n  <div class=\"progress-busy inert\" role=\"status\">\n    <span id=\"progress-busy\">\n    </span> \n  </div>\n</div>\n</example> -->\n\n## Further Reading\n\n* [WCAG 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-content.html)\n* [WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships)\n* [WCAG 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html)\n* [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value)\n* [WCAG 4.1.3 Status Messages (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages.html)"

Radio groups are not supposed to consist of nested interactive elements. Radio button focus order is not what you may expect.\n\n* By default, it is not expected behavior that each radio button can be tabbed to. This is how radio buttons naturally behave\n\n* As soon as a radio button is selected, the selected radio input receives focus first from the group. As a result screen reader users may not discover a nested control for an option if they start switching between radio buttons alone\n\n* To try to mitigate screen reader users not discovering the nested controls, describe the fieldset / radiogroup with non-visual text. This can be done with <code>aria-describedby</code> on the <code>fieldset</code>. For example, \"Edit controls are available which follow each radio button\"\n\n* Ensure the nested controls also have additional context defined by <code>aria-describedby</code>. This will help screen reader users understand their purpose.\n\n* Use of the same <code>name</code> attribute is important to link the radio buttons as a programmatic group\n\n* Keyboard functionality such as arrow up/down/left/right should change the selected radio button.\n\n```html\n<fieldset class=\"checkbox-radio-group\" aria-describedby=\"styled-radio-group-helper-text\">\n  <legend>Choose your payment method:</legend>\n  <!-- Visually hidden helper text describing fieldset -->\n  <!-- This text should only be present in the DOM if the radio group has nested controls.

A `<select>` does everything that the stepper input does, and with less code. Additionally, a `<select>` is a native HTML component and inherently accessible.\n\nThe stepper input component is useful for *small range increments*. If the max character count is more than 20, consider use of a [Text Input](/web-criteria/component/text-input) field as this component will be cumbersome for people using a mouse.\n\n```html\n<div>\n  <label for=\"stepper\">\n    Quantity\n  </label>\n  <div class=\"stepper\">\n      <button class=\"button minus\" \n               aria-label=\"Decrease Quantity\" \n               aria-disabled=\"true\"></button>\n      <select id=\"stepper\"\n               name=\"stepper-input\"\n               min=\"1\"\n               max=\"11\"\n               data-selected=\"1\">\n         <option value=\"1\" selected>1</option>\n         <option value=\"2\">2</option>\n         <option value=\"3\">3</option>\n         <option value=\"4\">4</option>\n         <option value=\"5\">5</option>\n         <option value=\"6\">6</option>\n         <option value=\"7\">7</option>\n         <option value=\"8\">8</option>\n         <option value=\"9\">9</option>\n         <option value=\"10\">10</option>\n         <option value=\"11\">11</option>\n      </select>\n      <button class=\"button plus\" \n                  aria-label=\"Increase Quantity\"></button>\n   </div>\n  <!-- live container where \"Quantity updated, [number]\" will be dynamically updated -->\n  <div aria-live=\"polite\" class=\"hidden\" id=\"stepper-status-target\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n<!-- TODO disabling buttons - both when minimum and maximum are hit -->\n\n<example>\n   <div>\n      <label for=\"stepper\">\n         Quantity\n      </label>\n      <div class=\"stepper\">\n            <button data-fn=\"decreaseSelectStepper\" \n                  data-icon=\"minus\" \n                  class=\"button minus\" \n                  aria-label=\"Decrease Quantity\" \n                  aria-disabled=\"true\"></button>\n            <select id=\"stepper\"\n                  name=\"stepper-input\"\n                  min=\"1\"\n                  max=\"11\"\n                  data-selected=\"1\">\n               <option value=\"1\" selected>1</option>\n               <option value=\"2\">2</option>\n               <option value=\"3\">3</option>\n               <option value=\"4\">4</option>\n               <option value=\"5\">5</option>\n               <option value=\"6\">6</option>\n               <option value=\"7\">7</option>\n               <option value=\"8\">8</option>\n               <option value=\"9\">9</option>\n               <option value=\"10\">10</option>\n               <option value=\"11\">11</option>\n            </select>\n            <button data-fn=\"increaseSelectStepper\" \n                  data-icon=\"plus\" \n                  class=\"button plus\" \n                  aria-label=\"Increase Quantity\"></button>\n         </div>\n      <!-- live container where \"Quantity updated, [number]\" will be dynamically updated -->\n      <div aria-live=\"polite\" class=\"hidden\" id=\"stepper-status-target-1\"></div>\n   </div>\n</example>\n\n### No-select stepper\n\n* Uses buttons to increment/decrement\n* Has an updating `aria-live` region to provide updates\n* Buttons should be disabled when the stepper hits its minimum or maximum value.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"stepper\">\n   <button id=\"decrement-button\" \n               data-fn=\"decreaseNumber\" \n               data-icon=\"minus\" \n               class=\"button minus\" \n               aria-label=\"Decrease Quantity\" \n               aria-disabled=\"true\">\n   </button>\n   <span id=\"step-number\">0</span>\n   <button data-icon=\"plus\" \n               data-fn=\"increaseNumber\" \n               class=\"button plus\" \n               aria-label=\"Increase Quantity\"></button>\n   <!-- live container where \"Quantity updated, [number]\" will be dynamically updated -->\n   <div aria-live=\"polite\" class=\"hidden\" id=\"stepper-status-target\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n<!-- TODO disabling button - decrement button should be disabled when at 0 -->\n\n<example>\n   <div class=\"stepper\">\n      <button id=\"decrement-button\" \n            data-fn=\"decreaseNumber\" \n            data-icon=\"minus\" \n            class=\"button minus\" \n            aria-label=\"Decrease Quantity\" \n            aria-disabled=\"true\"></button>\n      <span id=\"step-number\">0</span>\n      <button data-icon=\"plus\" \n            data-fn=\"increaseNumber\" \n            class=\"button plus\" \n            aria-label=\"Increase Quantity\"></button>\n      <!-- live container where \"Quantity updated, [number]\" will be dynamically updated -->\n      <div aria-live=\"polite\" class=\"hidden\" id=\"stepper-status-target\"></div>\n   </div>\n</example>\n\n## Developer notes\n\n* This stepper example provides both `button` and `select` elements for users to change a value.\n\n* A non-visual live container with `aria-live=\"polite\"` is present in the DOM on page load. When the `button` element is activated, this non-visual live container is updated with dynamic content that screen reader users will hear announced as they increment or decrement the value. This dynamic text is then removed from the DOM after a few seconds (but not the actual container with `aria-live=\"polite\"`) so the message is not discovered by screen reader users after interaction. The content of this message dynamically created based on the `label` for the `select` and the current value of the `select`, e.g. \"Quantity updated, 4\".\n\n* The value of the `select` element naturally communicates the updated value to screen reader users so the live container is not updated when interacting with that form element.\n\n* The `button` and `aria-label` values should be plain text and should include context of what they affect when activated (typically the label for the `select`), e.g. \"Increase Quantity\" or \"Add Quantity\".\n\n* The buttons will need `aria-disabled=\"true\"` applied when either end of the range is reached.\n\n* Related alternative patterns: [Select Dropdown](/web-criteria/component/select-dropdown) or an [WAI-ARIA Spin Button](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/spinbutton/examples/datepicker-spinbuttons/)."

          "developerNotes": "## Tab groups\n\nTabs can be useful in scenarios where content is repetitive and doesn't require direct comparison. In these instances, they can effectively organize information without compromising functionality. When implemented thoughtfully, tabs can enhance accessibility by simplifying navigation and helping users quickly locate the information they need.\n\nHowever, tab groups can also pose challenges for accessibility and usability when not implemented effectively. Poorly designed tab groups often lead to a cluttered presentation of content, which can detract from the overall user experience rather than enhance it. Ensuring that tab groups are thoughtfully structured is crucial for making content more accessible and user-friendly.\n\n### Potential issues with tab groups:\n\n* **Accessibility**: Many screen reader users struggle with navigating tab groups using arrow keys, potentially missing crucial content.\n* **Interaction Rates**: Engagement is typically low for content beyond the first tab panel.\n* **Visibility of Content**: Content is hidden by default, and not all users are aware of how to access it.\n* **Comparative Information**: Users cannot easily compare information presented across multiple tabs.\n\n### Recommended alternatives:\n\nInstead of using tab groups, consider these alternatives:\n\n* Breaking the page into clear sections with concise copywriting.\n* Use expandable sections (accordions) for better organization.\n* Create separate pages for different topics\n\n### Tab activation types:\n\nTabs can be built to be activated **automatically** or **manually**.\n\n* **Automatic** tabs become activated immediately upon focus via a mouse click or the arrow keys.\n* **Manual** tabs can receive focus via the arrow keys, but require the user to press either `Enter` or `Space`, or click them with their mouse to activate them.\n\nYou can find additional guidance as well as examples of automatic and manually activated tab groups on the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide Tabs Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/) page.\n\n### Code considerations\n\n* **Tablist**: The main container for tabs requires `role=\"tablist\"`.\n* **Tabs**: Each tab within the `tablist` requires `role=\"tab\"`.\n* **Content Panels**: Each content area for a tab is called a `role=\"tabpanel\"`.\n* **Labels**: Each `tabpanel` needs to have an `aria-labelledby` attribute that points to the corresponding `tab` label.\n* **Control Association**: Each `tab` has an `aria-controls` attribute linking it to its corresponding `tabpanel`.\n* **Active Tab**: The currently selected tab has `aria-selected` set to true; all other tabs have it set to false.\n* **Orientation**: If the tablist is vertical, it has `aria-orientation` set to vertical. By default, it is horizontal.\n\n### Code Example\n\n```html\n<div class=\"tabs\">\n  <div role=\"tablist\">\n    <button role=\"tab\"\n            aria-selected=\"true\" \n            aria-controls=\"alpha-tab\" \n            id=\"alpha\">\n            Alpha\n    </button>\n    <button role=\"tab\" \n            aria-selected=\"false\" \n            aria-controls=\"bravo-tab\" \n            id=\"bravo\" \n            tabindex=\"-1\">\n            Bravo\n    </button>\n    <button role=\"tab\" \n            aria-selected=\"false\" \n            aria-controls=\"charlie-tab\" \n            id=\"charlie\" \n            tabindex=\"-1\">\n            Charlie\n    </button>\n  </div>\n  <div role=\"tabpanel\" \n       id=\"alpha-tab\" \n       aria-labelledby=\"alpha\"\n       tabindex=\"0\">\n    <p>Alpha is the first letter of the NATO alphabet</p>\n  </div>\n  <div role=\"tabpanel\" \n       id=\"bravo-tab\" \n       aria-labelledby=\"bravo\"\n       tabindex=\"0\">\n    <p>Bravo is the second letter of the NATO alphabet</p>\n  </div>\n  <div role=\"tabpanel\" \n       id=\"charlie-tab\" \n       aria-labelledby=\"charlie\"\n       tabindex=\"0\">\n    <p>Charlie is the third letter of the NATO alphabet</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```"

One of them is hidden from screen readers by use of `aria-hidden=\"true\"` and the other visually hidden container's content is dynamically updated after a slight pause. This is to ensure the screen reader does not interrupt the announcement of the key pressed with the announcement of the dynamic counter text update.\n* While the visible counter text container is hidden with `aria-hidden=\"true\"` it is still programmatically associated with the textarea by use of `aria-describedby`. This will ensure the text will be announced when the textarea receives focus.\n* **Delay the update** for dynamic `role=\"status\"` counter\n  * Use `setTimeout`to allow the accessibility tree and screen reader time to update in a logical fashion e.g. 1500ms\n* **Do not** reference the `role=\"status\"` element with aria-describedby\n  * This causes a bug in VoiceOver\n\n```javascript\nconst textarea = document.getElementById('message');\nif(textarea) {\n    const chars = document.getElementById('currentChars');\n    const srOutputTarget = document.getElementById('sr-counter-target');\n    textarea.addEventListener(\"input\", event => {\n        const target = event.currentTarget;\n        const maxLength = target.getAttribute(\"maxlength\");\n        const currentLength = target.value.length;\n        // update the visible counter text\n        chars.innerHTML = maxLength - currentLength;\n        // update the visually hidden counter text\n        setTimeout(function() {\n            srOutputTarget.innerHTML = maxLength - currentLength;\n        },1000);\n    });\n}\n```\n\n```html\n<label for=\"message\">\n  Your message\n</label>\n\n<textarea \n  id=\"message\"\n  maxlength=\"50\"\n  aria-describedby=\"charcounter\">\n</textarea>\n\n<div role=\"status\">\n  <!-- Do not reference the status element with aria-describedby \n       Doing so will not work in VoiceOver -->\n  <div id=\"charcounter\" class=\"hint\">\n    <span id=\"currentChars\">50</span> \n    of 50\n    <span class=\"hidden\">\n      characters remaining\n    </span>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n<!-- TODO JS for countdown of characters -->\n\n<example>\n   <label for=\"message\">\n   Your message\n   </label>\n   <textarea \n   id=\"message\"\n   maxlength=\"50\"\n   aria-describedby=\"charcounter\">\n   </textarea>\n   <div role=\"status\">\n   <!-- Do not reference the status element with aria-describedby \n         Doing so will not work in VoiceOver -->\n   <div id=\"charcounter\" class=\"hint\">\n      <span id=\"currentChars\">50</span> \n      of 50\n      <span class=\"hidden\">\n         characters remaining\n      </span>\n   </div>\n   </div>\n</example>"

          "developerNotes": "## Rethinking Toast Snackbars\n\nToast snackbars might seem like an easy way to provide feedback, but they’re often not the best fit for accessible and user-friendly design. Here’s why:\n\n* Accessibility Limitations: Because snackbars are custom HTML elements, they lack semantic meaning and can be challenging for assistive technologies like screen readers.\n* Missed Messages: If a user doesn’t catch a snackbar in time, it’s difficult to go back and review the information.\n* Auditory Clutter: For screen readers, snackbars can create unnecessary noise, especially if they appear frequently or unexpectedly.\n* Unclear Rules: Like tooltips, snackbars are tricky to define and test consistently in design criteria.\n\n### Instead use an inline element to indicate a change\n\n* Inline Feedback: Inject a success message *in proximity* to the updated control\n* Accessible Undo/Redo Options: Place these buttons in clear, easy-to-navigate locations.\n* Thoughtful Confirmations: Use a confirmation screen for critical actions or when users are exiting an important flow.\n\n```html\n<fieldset class=\"switch\">\n    <legend>Marketing preferences</legend>\n    <input class=\"hidden-visually\" data-fn=\"openToast\" type=\"checkbox\" role=\"switch\" id=\"spam\">\n    <label for=\"spam\">  Send me constant spam</label>\n    <div id=\"hint-spam\" role=\"alert\" class=\"alert notification inert\">\n        <div id=\"hint-spam-message\">\n            Spam preferences saved\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</fieldset>\n```\n\n<example>\n<fieldset class=\"switch\">\n  <legend>Marketing preferences</legend>\n <input class=\"hidden-visually\" data-fn=\"openToast\" type=\"checkbox\" role=\"switch\" id=\"spam\">\n  <label for=\"spam\">  Send me constant spam</label>\n  <div id=\"hint-spam\" role=\"alert\" class=\"alert notification inert\">\n    <div id=\"hint-spam-message\">\n      Spam preferences saved\n    </div>     \n  </div>\n</fieldset>\n</example>\n\n### When Toast Snackbars Don’t Work:\n\nThere are certain scenarios where snackbars simply aren’t the right tool:\n\n* Critical or Irreversible Actions: For example, “Unsend this message” or “Confirm payment.” These require deliberate, visible feedback\n* Blocking Error Messages: Important errors should grab attention and provide clear guidance—not rely on a fleeting message.\n* Page-Load Alerts: Automatically showing messages on page load can confuse users, particularly those using screen readers.\n\n### Timing\n\nIf you find a situation where a toast snackbar is truly necessary:\n\n* Avoid auto-dismiss wherever possible.\n* If dismissal must be automatic, make sure the [timing is adjustable to meet WCAG 2.2.1 standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/timing-adjustable.html).\n\n## Only use toast snackbars to *reinforce* updates\n\n* If using a snackbar is unavoidable, it must only be used for non-critical messaging.\n* The status injected must also be discernable on the page *without the snackbar*.\n\n### Practical example\n\nGiven that I am on a dynamic single page application\n\n* WHEN the customer changes the state of a toggle to OFF or ON\n  * THEN the toast appears to *reinforce* that the change has been saved\n  * AND the customer can confirm this is true from the toggle itself\n\n## Code example\n\n```html\n<div id=\"toast\">\n  <span id=\"toast-message\" role=\"status\">\n    <!-- Inject snackbar message here -->\n  </span>\n  <button type=\"button\">\n    Dismiss\n  </button>\n</div>\n```"

Test keyboard only, then screen reader + keyboard actions\n   * Skip-links: Not commonly used for form entry, but useful for jumping to a form landmark.\n   * Tab: Focus moves to each form control in logical order, strong visual focus indicator.\n   * Forms mode: Enabled when screen reader lands on a form field.\n\n2. Test mobile screenreader gestures\n   * Swipe: Focus moves to form controls inside the form.\n   * Doubletap: Activates controls as expected.\n\n3. Listen to screenreader output on all devices\n   * Role: It is discoverable with screenreader shortcuts as a form landmark along with its name\n   * Name: If multiple forms are present (Ex: Search, Sign in, Newsletter subscription), the form must have a name.\n   * Group: Groups of related fields are identified with fieldset/legend or aria attributes.\n   * Instructions: Presented before the form or inline, announced in order.\n   * Errors: Errors are announced when inputs are invalid.\n\nFull information: [https://www.magentaa11y.com/#/web-criteria/page-level/form](/web-criteria/page-level/form)",

          "developerNotes": "## Building accessible forms\n\n### Do not auto focus inputs\n\n* Automatically moving focus to an input field is very confusing for people using assistive technology.\n\n### Group inputs\n\nUse `fieldset` and `legend` to group related fields, such as:\n\n* Sign in\n* Shipping address\n* Payment information\n\n### Error handling\n\n* Individual inputs must have <a href=\"https://www.magentaa11y.com/#/web-criteria/component/help-hint-error\">programmatically described errors</a> read by the screen reader on focus.\n* For long forms, list all errors in an <a href=\"https://www.magentaa11y.com/#/web-criteria/component/alert-notification\">alert</a> with links back to each invalid input on submission attempts.\n\n## UX guidance\n\n### Affordance: field width indicates the expected input\n\nForm field width should afford the user space to enter the characters that will be required. Do not arbitrarily limit the width of names, usernames, passwords or emails.\n\nPractical Examples\n\n* Middle initial should be wide enough to accommodate 1 character\n* State abbreviations should be wide enough to accommodate 2 characters\n* Zip code must be wide enough to accommodate 5 characters\n* Pin numbers reflect the number of digits expected\n\n### Why we stack inputs\n\nDo not put forms in multiple columns.\n\n* People are accustomed to scrolling vertically. There is no advantage to making the page take up less vertical space.\n* People with low vision may be using a zoom tool, enlarging the view of their screen and thus only seeing a portion of the form. If there is a column on the right side, it will be difficult to discover the fields.\n* Do not place submit buttons in a sidebar unless there is also a submit button at the bottom of the form\n\n### Why we use autocomplete\n\n* Utilizing <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/autocomplete\">autocomplete</a> allows users automated assistance in filling out form field values.\n* Autocomplete is helpful for all customers leading to a speedier conversion\n* For those with motor disabilities, it eliminates the need to laboriously enter information\n\n## Code examples\n\n### Use semantic HTML\n\n```html\n<form aria-label=\"Sign in\">\n  <fieldset>\n    <legend>Sign in</legend>\n    <label for=\"username\">Username</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\">\n    <button type=\"submit\">Sign in</button>\n  </fieldset>\n</form>\n```\n\n<example>\n    <form aria-label=\"Sign in\">\n      <fieldset>\n        <legend>Sign in</legend>\n        <label for=\"username\">Username</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\">\n        <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary\" type=\"submit\">Sign in</button>\n      </fieldset>\n    </form>\n</example>\n\n### Credit card information\n\nUse `fieldset` and `legend` to group related fields, such as:\n\n* This form uses minimal unobtrusive masking to make the credit card number more readable. (When done poorly, masking can can cause the field to be read repeatedly as the mask refreshes)\n* Autofill attributes to help customers complete fields with less effort.\n* Using `inputmode=\"numeric\"` brings up the numeric keyboard on mobile devices making entry easier.\n\n```html\n<form aria-label=\"Payment information\">\n  <fieldset>\n    <legend>\n      Enter your

In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement.\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n* `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true) {}` is equivalent to `importantForAccessibility` when compared to android views\n* `FocusRequester.createRefs()` helps to request focus to inner elements with in the group\n\n***\n\n### State\n\n#### Android Views\n\n* Active: `android:enabled=true`\n* Disabled: `android:enabled=false`. Announcement: disabled\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n* Active: default state is active and enabled. Use `Button(enabled = true)` to specify explicitly\n* Disabled:  `Button(enabled = false)` announces as disabled\n* Alternatively can use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { disabled() }` to announce as disabled\n* Use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { stateDescription = \"\" }` to have a customized state announcement\n\n***\n\n### Focus\n\n* Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes needs focus management\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place (back button, screen title, first text field, first heading), except when changing between navigation tabs\n* When a menu, picker or modal is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n#### Android Views\n\n* `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API\n* `android:focusable`\n* `android=clickable`\n* Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`\n* `nextFocusDown`\n* `nextFocusUp`\n* `nextFocusRight`\n* `nextFocusLeft`\n* `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)\n* To hide controls: `importantForAccessibility=false`\n* For a `ViewGroup`, set `screenReaderFocusable=true` and each inner object’s attribute to keyboard focus (`focusable=false`)\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n* `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable\n* `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with FocusRequesters to define focus order\n* `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state\n* `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views\n* Example: To customize the focus events\n  * step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`\n  * step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`\n  * focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end\n  * step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus\n\n***\n\n### Custom Accessibility Action\n\n* When UI elements are customized and coded to look like a specific component say button, to ensure that name, role, state and action are all intact might need to update accessibility service and semantics.\n* Disclaimer: This customization would not be needed unless it is required to modify/add gestures or actions.\n* The Button class by default supplies all the necessary semantics to make it fully accessible.\n\n#### Android Views\n\n* step 1: Create an accessibility service\n* step 2: Add the `FLAG_REQUEST_ACCESSIBILITY_BUTTON` flag in an AccessibilityServiceInfo object's `android:accessibilityFlags` attribute\n* step 3: To have a custom service register for the button's custom action callbacks, use `registerAccessibilityButtonCallback()`\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n* List of custom accessibility actions can be defined relatively easily in compose compared to Views using customActions.\n* Example: `modifier = Modifier.semantics { customActions = listOf(CustomAccessibilityAction(label = \"\", action = { true }))}`\n\n***\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* \"button\" in announcements below comes from the accessibility services most of the time when a native component is used, not from \"button\" in the label\n  * **Note:** When the user has hints turned on in settings, \"double tap to activate\" will announce at the end of most interactive controls.  Testing should be done with hints turned on to ensure the user understands a control is interactive by hearing either \"button\" or \"double tap to activate\" or both.  Announcements on Android devices vary slightly due to manufacturer.\n* \"Label, button, double tap to activate\"\n* \"Label, (other content in cell), button, double tap to activate\" (grouping)\n* \"Label, button, selected, double tap to activate\" (selected state)\n* \"Label, disabled\" (disabled state)",

If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.\n* When naming a button, do not add “button” to the programmatic name (label). Assigning “Button” as the role will handle this announcement.\n  * **Incorrect announcement**: “Submit button, Button”\n  * **Correct announcement**: “Submit, Button”\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n  * The button’s title will overwrite the button’s `accessibilityLabel`.\n* If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the button’s `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n  * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n* To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label’s `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n* To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `AccessibilityEnabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n* If button has icon(s), hide the icon(s) from VoiceOver by using view modifier `accessibilityHidden(true)`.\n\n***\n\n### Role\n\n* When using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* Use `UIButton`\n* If necessary, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.button`.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* Use native `Button` view\n* If necessary, use view modifier `accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)` to assign the role as `Button`.\n* If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits.\n\n***\n\n### Groupings\n\nGroup visible label with button, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the button and not duplicate the name announcement\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n* Set `isAccessibilityElement` to true for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n* If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n  * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n* Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n* Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildre`n to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* Use view `modifier accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n***\n\n### State\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n* For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is “Dimmed”.\n  * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* For selected, use `accessibilityAddTraits(.isSelected)`.\n* For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n***\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading, except when changing between navigation tabs\n* When a menu, picker, or modal is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n  * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n* Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n* `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n* If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n***\n\n### Announcement examples\n\nOptions for announcements below depend on implementation. Announcement order can vary.\n\n* \"Label, button\"\n* \"Label, (other content in cell), button\" (grouping)\n* \"Label, button, selected\" (selected state)\n* \"Label, dimmed, button\" (disabled state)\n\n***",

          "iosDeveloperNotes": "### General Notes\n\n* Use native app calendar date pickers when possible vs a custom element, as the native app picker will handle expected behavior without additional development effort\n* Calendar image often needs alt text and is sometimes grouped with the label of the field\n* The native calendar has a few circles for selected dates, but there are limitations in the colors resulting in insufficient color contrast minimum ratios, as well as the color for the days of the week\n* Natively, VoiceOver announces the disabled/unavailable dates as dimmed\n* The month is adjustable (swipe up or down to change) and can also be changed via the wheel picker with double tap\n* Arrow buttons to change the month and year and not in the swipe order for the screen reader, since there is an alternate way to change the dates\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control.\n\n* It is the name of the element that opens the date picker.\n\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.\n\n* Placeholder or value text is NOT the programmatic name\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n    * Setting the triggering element's title will overwrite its `accessibilityLabel`.\n  * If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the trigger's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`\n\n### Role\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Use `UIDatePicker` (It is a custom subclass of `UIPickerView` so the functionality and accessibility between the two will be similar)\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Use native `DatePicker` view\n  * If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits\n\n### Groupings\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n    * If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n      * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n### State\n\n* By default, disabled or unavailable dates are announced as \"dimmed\"\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * For enabled trigger element: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled trigger element: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, close button, first text field, or first heading.\n\n* When the date picker is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* “Double tap to dismiss pop up window” (First invisible element) (on later versions)\n* Header announces as \"heading\"\n* “Close, button” (Close X button)\n* “Month, button, adjustable, double tap to change month and year, swipe up or down with one finger to adjust the value” (Month and year button)\n* “Day, Date, button” (Each date)\n* “Selected, Day, Date, button” (Selected date)\n* “Day, Date, dimmed, button” (Disabled or unavailable date)",

At least one of the options in the above success criteria for navigating through the elements/slides must be available\n* Slides cannot automatically start rotating through carousel unless there is a pause/stop button\n* Consider the number of slides/elements in carousel when choosing implementation.  Swiping right through the slides of a very large number of slides to get to the next element past the carousel would not be a good user experience.\n* The container around the carousel on Android can be an alternative for the user to bypass all the slides.  The user can enter the container to navigate through the slides, or swipe to the next element past the container.\n  * When navigating to a carousel with the screen reader, it should first focus on the entire carousel container\n  * Each carousel may have a different number of items, so the label includes the total amount of items and the current item in focus\n  * Then, activating the carousel container focuses on the first carousel item\n  * Two finger swipe rt or left navigates through the slides putting focus on the next slide in the order\n* Alternate implementation to swiping through carousel: Change the slides with interactive page control dots and dynamically announce all the content in the slide along with page index (without focus on slides, just on the dots)\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name of any interactive element describes it's purpose.\n\n* Each item in the carousel, if interactive, has a name that describes the purpose of the control and matches any visible label/all text and image descriptions within item.\n\n* **Android View**\n  * `android:text` XML attribute\n  * Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name, depending on type of view and for elements without a visible label.\n  * `contentDescription` overrides `android:text`\n  * Use `labelFor` attribute to associate the visible label to the control\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * If no visible label, use compose modifier semantics `contentDescription`.\n  * If any icons or images need to be hidden for accessibility talkback, use compose modifier semantics `invisibleToUser()`\n\n### Role\n\n* The native Pager component will handle the built-in accessibility behavior\n\n* Each item in the carousel can have the independent role and accessibility trait. For example, if the item is clickable, the role should be `button`.\n\n* **Android View**\n  * ViewPager\n  * CarouselView\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * Compose foundation `HorizontalPager` and `VerticalPager`\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with the carousel, if applicable.\n* Group the title and any description with each item in the carousel\n* If the item in carousel is clickable, use compose modifier `clickable` which will group the child elements automatically.\n* If the item in carousel has multi-actions, then spilt the action out of the group with proper focus order on each actions.\n* **Android View**\n  * `ViewGroup`\n  * Set the container object's `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false.

Use `Button(enabled = true)` or `clickable {enabled = true}` to specify explicitly\n  * Disabled:  `Button(enabled = false)` or `clickable {enabled = false}` announces as disabled\n  * Alternatively can use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { disabled() }` to announce as disabled\n\n### Focus\n\n* Each slide/element in the carousel should be in the view area when it is being announced\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* **Android View**\n  * `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API\n  * `android:focusable`\n  * `android=clickable`\n  * Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`\n  * `nextFocusDown`\n  * `nextFocusUp`\n  * `nextFocusRight`\n  * `nextFocusLeft`\n  * `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)\n  * To hide controls: `Important_For_Accessibility_false`\n  * For a `ViewGroup`, set `screenReaderFocusable=true` and each inner object’s attribute to keyboard focus (`focusable=false`)\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable\n  * `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with FocusRequesters to define focus order\n  * `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state\n  * `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views\n  * *Example:* To customize the focus events behaviour\n    * step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`\n    * step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`\n    * focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end\n    * step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus\n\n### Code Example\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n```java\n// Example of Compose horizontal pager with single page snapping\nval state = rememberPagerState { 10 }\nHorizontalPager(\n    state = state,\n    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),\n) { pageIndex ->\n    Box(\n        modifier = Modifier\n            .padding(10.dp)\n            .background(Color.Blue)\n            .fillMaxWidth()\n            .aspectRatio(1f),\n        contentAlignment = Alignment.Center\n    ) {\n        Text(text = pageIndex.toString(), fontSize = 32.sp)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Announcements\n\n* “In list” or “Showing slides x of y” are common announcements to give screen readers layout context when landing on carousel container\n* “Swipe right with two fingers to change slides” – common navigation announcement",
          "iosDeveloperNotes": "### General Notes\n\n* A carousel is a list of related content items as a horizontal slideshow\n* There are a variety of implementation alternatives for a carousel. At least one of the options in the above success criteria for navigating through the elements/slides must be available\n* Slides cannot automatically start rotating through carousel unless there is a pause/stop button\n* Consider the number of slides/elements in carousel when choosing implementation.  Swiping right through the slides of a very large number of slides to get to the next element past the carousel would not be a good user experience. Custom actions/gestures for navigation through the slides should be considered on large carousels on iOS.  Then, if the user wants to bypass all the slides, they would simply swipe right to the next element past the carousel\n* Alternate implementation to swiping through carousel: Change the slides with interactive page control dots and dynamically announce all the content in the slide along with page index (without focus on slides, only on the dots)\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name of any interactive element describes it's purpose\n\n* Append \", Carousel\" to the programmatic name to announce the role, since the carousel is custom and does not have a native role assigned\n\n* If visible text label exists for an interactive component, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n    * The carousel's title will overwrite the carousel's `accessibilityLabel`.\n  * If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the carousel's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n  * If button has icon(s), hide the icon(s) from VoiceOver by using view modifier `accessibilityHidden(true)`.\n\n### Role\n\n* Since there is no native carousel component, a custom carousel must be implemented.\n\n* The carousel itself has its own role indicated by appending \", Carousel\" to the programmatic name.\n\n* Each item in the carousel has its own independent role or accessibility trait. For example, if the item is interactive, the role will be `.button`.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * A common method of implementing a carousel involves using `UICollectionView` and its corresponding protocols. Each item of the carousel is a `UICollectionViewCell`.\n  * Set the `accessibilityTraits` of the overall carousel role to `.adjustable`, and then append \", Carousel\" to the programmatic name to notify the user of the role\n  * An individual item of the carousel will have its own role that is dependent on whether it is interactive. Assign the role that best fits your use case.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * As there are different ways to implement a carousel, use your best judgment for your use case.\n  * Append \", Carousel\" to the programmatic name for the overall carousel\n  * An individual item of the carousel will have its own role that is dependent on whether it is interactive. Assign the role that best fits your use case.\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityAddTraits(:)` to add traits.\n  * If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits.\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with the carousel, if applicable.\n\n* Group the title and any description with each item in the carousel.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n    * If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n      * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n### State\n\n* Indicate where the item is in the carousel by announcing the position/index out of the total number of items. (see Announcements below)\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Custom Gestures\n\n* The expected experience is that when users swipe left or right, they are navigating from one section of the screen to another. When users swipe up or down on the carousel, the user is scrolling through the carousel\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * First, ensure that the accessibility trait of the carousel is `.adjustable`.\n  * Then, you are able to take advantage of the `accessibilityIncrement` and `accessibilityDecrement` methods\n\n  ```swift\n  override func accessibilityIncrement() {\n      // Move forward one item\n\n  }\n\n  override func accessibilityDecrement() {\n      // Move backward one item\n\n  }\n  ```\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * There are many approaches to applying custom gestures to a component\n  * One suggestion is to use `.accessibilityAdjustableAction` with a `switch` statement for the `direction`, and changing the index of the cell depending on whether the direction is `.increment` or `.decrement`\n\n    * \"Incrementing\" should move to the next item\n    * \"Decrementing\" should move to the previous item\n\n    ```swift\n    .accessibilityAdjustableAction { direction in\n        switch direction {\n        case .increment:\n            // Go to next page\n\n        case .decrement:\n            // Go to previous page\n\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n### Announcements\n\n* “Showing slides x of y” are common announcements to give screen readers context of layout\n* “Custom actions available.

It should not automatically navigate the user to another field or screen when activated, as that may cause a change of context. Revealing new information on the same screen as a result of activating a checkbox is usually ok, as it is not a change of context.\n* Name, Role, State must be announced when focus is on the control. Announcing the label only in a separate swipe before the checkbox does not meet this requirement.\n\n#### Code example\n\n```java\nval checkedState = remember { mutableStateOf(true) }\nval stateNotSubscribed = \"Not Selected\"\nval stateSubscribed = \"Selected\"\nRow(\n  modifier = Modifier\n        .semantics {\n            stateDescription = if (checkedState.value) { stateSubscribed } else { stateNotSubscribed }\n            contentDescription = \"Subscribe\"\n        }\n        .toggleable(\n            value = checkedState.value,\n            onValueChange = { checkedState.value = it },\n            role = Role.Checkbox\n        )\n  ) {\n    Checkbox(\n            modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.CenterVertically),\n            checked = checkedState.value,\n            onCheckedChange = null\n    )\n        Text(text = \"Subscription\")\n    }\n```\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control\n\n* Programmatic name matches the visible text label\n\n* **Android Views**\n  * `android:text` XML attribute\n  * Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name, depending on type of view and for elements (icons) without a visible label\n  * `contentDescription` overrides `android:text`\n  * Use `labelFor` attribute to associate the visible label with the control (best practice)\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * By default, the simple checkbox composable is readout & focused separately from its label text, which makes it hard to understand the context.\n  * Use `Row` composable and `toggleable(role = Role.Checkbox)` with inner element as `Checkbox` composable (recommended practice) to have entire row including its label focused for selection, so it allows screenreader to read the name and role together.\n  * Optional: use `Modifier.semantics {  contentDescription = \"\" }` for a more descriptive name\n\n### Role\n\n* When not using native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n* **Android Views**\n  * CheckBox Class\n  * Announced as \"checkbox\"\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * Simple checkbox composable.\n  * Alternatively use checkbox composable in combination with `Row` and `toggleable(role = Role.Checkbox)`.

This makes the entire row group selectable including its label.\n  * `FocusRequester` can be used to request focus to individual components with in the group. More on FocusRequester in the focus section below.\n\n### State\n\n* When native code is not available for a state, add the state to the programmatic name (label).

A common control for custom checkboxes to extend from is the `UIButton`, but choose the native control that best fits your use case.\n    * Provide your own checked and unchecked checkbox images\n    * Implement action handlers for your custom checkbox\n    * Set accessibility properties accordingly\n  * If necessary, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.button`. Be sure to set the accessibility value to either \"Checked\" or \"Unchecked\" to indicate that this control behaves as a checkbox.\n  * An alternative to setting the accessibility trait to `.button` is removing and hiding the accessibility trait using `accessibilityTraits.remove(:)`. Then, append \", Checkbox\" to the programmatic name\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use native `Toggle` view with `toggleStyle(.checkbox)`\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with checkbox, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the checkbox.\n\n* Group the units such that the label, role, and state of the checkbox is announced in a single announcement.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n  * If frame does not exist, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n    * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n  * If the tap gesture is removed due to grouping logic, restore the tap gesture functionality using bindings to bind the tap gesture of the container with the state of the checkbox.\n\n### State\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * For checked state: Set `accessibilityValue` to \"Checked\"\n  * For unchecked state: Optionally, set `accessibilityValue` to \"Unchecked\"\n  * For enabled state: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For checked state, if necessary: Set accessibility value to \"Checked\" with `accessibility(:)`\n  * For unchecked state, if necessary: Set accessibility value to \"Unchecked\" with `accessibilityValue(:)`\n  * For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* Appending checkbox to label:\n* \"Label checkbox, checked, button\"\n* \"Label checkbox, not checked, button\"  (not checked or \"unselected\" are acceptable)\n* Not appending to label:\n* \"Label, checked, button\"\n* \"Label, not checked, button\"  (both \"not checked\" or \"unselected\" are acceptable)",

This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n#### State\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`.\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n\n**SwiftUI**\n\n* For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n#### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading.\n\n* When the picker is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n* If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n  * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n\n* Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n\n* `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n#### Announcement examples\n\n* For button that opens time/date picker: \"Birthday, button, activate to choose type, actions available\"\n* Value is announced along with role when picker opens: \"November, picker item, adjustable\"\n* Announcement for disabled state is \"dimmed\"",

          "iosDeveloperNotes": "There is no native dropdown element for iOS.  The notes below are suggestions and accessibility guidance.\n\n### General Notes\n\n* A dropdown is a button that opens a list of options.  When an option is chosen, it displays in the field as the value\n* The difference between a menu and dropdown is a menu item performs an action when activated.  A dropdown item only replaces the current option\n* The screen reader focus moves directly to first option in dropdown upon double tapping the dropdown button and is confined in the list.\n* Sometimes, a hidden \"dismiss context menu\" button after the last item is available to close it.\n* Focus should go back to the triggering dropdown button, displaying the new option\n* There must be a visible label for the dropdown field that is not a placeholder and it describes the purpose of the dropdown.\n* The screen reader focus also remains confined in the dropdown list\n* The state of expanded or collapsed should be announced\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control.\n\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognition\n\n* When naming a button, do not add \"button\" to the programmatic name (label). Assigning \"Button\" as the role will handle this announcement.\n  * **Incorrect announcement:** \"Submit button, Button\"\n  * **Correct announcement:** \"Submit, Button\"\n\n* Placeholder or value text is NOT the programmatic name\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n    * The button’s title will overwrite the button’s `accessibilityLabel`.\n  * If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the button's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n  * If button has icon(s), hide the icon(s) from VoiceOver by using view modifier `accessibilityHidden(true)`.\n\n### Role\n\n* When using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n* One option is to use a table view and a button inside a UIStackView\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * Use `UIButton`\n  * If necessary, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.button`.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use native `Button` view\n  * If necessary, use view modifier `accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)` to assign the role as Button.\n  * If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits.\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with button, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the button.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n    * If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n      * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n### State\n\n* In the case of expandable dropdowns, state of the dropdown must be announced (i.e. expanded/collapsed). Add logic and announcements to the programmatic name for the state.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * If applicable, dropdown items should be announced whether they are selected/unselected, in the cases of radio buttons or checkboxes.\n  * For enabled dropdown items: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled dropdown items: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the dropdown item to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the dropdown item.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * If applicable, dropdown items should be announced whether they are selected/unselected, in the cases of radio buttons or checkboxes.\n  * For selected dropdown items, use `accessibilityAddTraits(.isSelected)`.\n  * For disabled dropdown items, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading.\n\n* When a menu, picker, or modal is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* \"Button label, chosen option label, button, collapsed\"  (Button that opens dropdown with selected option from dropdown and state)\n* \"Selected, chosen option label, button\" (Selected option in dropdown list)\n* \"Label, button\" (Other options in list that populate dropdown)\n* \"Dismiss context menu, button\"  (Optional Hidden button that closes dropdown)",

As part of a table row/list view, the label, images and other non-interactive content in the row are usually announced together.

          "iosDeveloperNotes": "There is no native expandable or accordion element for iOS.  The notes below are suggestions and accessibility guidance.\n\n### General Notes\n\n* An expandable region is a view that shows items in a two-level list; groups which can individually be expanded to show its children.\n* The expand/collapses indicator (caret) is not focused separately.  As part of a table row/list view, the label, images and other non-interactive content in the row are usually announced together. The caret shows the state, which should be announced as part of the whole row announcement.\n* When the row is activated to expand, the focus stays on that row and does not automatically move to the new content.\n* Name, Role, State must be stated in a single announcement when focus is on the control area (caret icon should not gain focus alone).\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control.\n\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognition.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n    * The expandable region title will overwrite the expandable region `accessibilityLabel`.\n  * If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the expandable region `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n\n### Role\n\n* When using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * Use `UIButton`\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use native `DisclosureGroup` view\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with button, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the button.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n    * If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n      * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new `accessibilityElement`.\n\n### State\n\n* Append “expanded” or “collapsed” to the `accessibilityLabel` or `accessibilityValue` of the button (with logic)\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For selected, use `accessibilityAddTraits(.isSelected)`.\n  * For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* “Amenities, 2 Hotel amenities selected, collapsed, double tap to activate”  (Label, data, state, role/action)",

Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n  * If frame does not exist due to custom development, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n    * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n* After grouping the paragraph and the in-line link to form a single accessibility element, bind the link action to it.\n  * For the screen reader experience, focus will surround the paragraph container. Double-tapping the paragraph will activate the link.\n  * For the non-screen reader experience, do not bind the link action to the paragraph container. Non-screen readers must tap on the link itself to activate the link.\n\n### State\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n* For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n  * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the link to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the link.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading.\n* When a link is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* Implement focus ring to be around the paragraph container, so that double-tapping the container will activate the in-line link, given that there is only one link inside the container.\n* If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n  * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n* `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* Implement focus ring to be around the paragraph container, so that double-tapping the container will activate the in-line link, given that there is only one link inside the container.\n* For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n* If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* Announcement order can vary\n* \"Label, link\"\n* \"All text in paragraph including url, link\" (link in paragraph)\n* \"Label, dimmed, link\" (disabled)\n\n### Further reading\n\n* [UIAccessibilityTraits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilitytraits)",

(Not label, label, data, data)\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * `ViewGroup`\n  * Set the container object's `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false. In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement.\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * When use built-in Composable `DropdownMenuItem` in `DropdownMenu`, then it has the default grouping with the elements inside.\n  * Use `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true) {}` when work on the customized menu items\n  * `FocusRequester.createRefs()` helps to request focus to inner elements with in the group\n\n### State\n\n* Expandable menus\n  * State must be announced - expands/collapses, opens/closes. Add logic and announcement to the programmatic name for the state\n  * If \"opens\" or \"closes\" is not included in the name, the expands/collapses state must be announced\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * Active: `android:enabled=true`\n  * Disabled: `android:enabled=false`. Announcement: disabled\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * Active: default state is active and enabled. Use `DropdownMenuItem(enabled = true)` to specify explicitly\n  * Disabled:  `DropdownMenuItem(enabled = false)` announces as disabled\n  * Alternatively can use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { disabled() }` to announce as disabled\n  * Use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { stateDescription = \"\" }` to have a customized state announcement\n\n### Focus\n\n* Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes needs focus management\n\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place (back button, screen title, first text field, first heading)\n\n* When a menu, picker or modal is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API\n  * `android:focusable`\n  * `android=clickable`\n  * Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`\n  * `nextFocusDown`\n  * `nextFocusUp`\n  * `nextFocusRight`\n  * `nextFocusLeft`\n  * `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)\n  * To hide controls: `importantForAccessibility=false`\n  * For a `ViewGroup`, set `screenReaderFocusable=true` and each inner object’s attribute to keyboard focus (`focusable=false`)\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable\n  * `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with FocusRequesters to define focus order\n  * `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state\n  * `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views\n  * Example: To customize the focus events\n    * step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`\n    * step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`\n    * focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end\n    * step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus\n\n### Code Example\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n```java\nvar expanded by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }\nDropdownMenu(\n    expanded = expanded,\n    onDismissRequest = { expanded = false }\n) {\n    DropdownMenuItem(\n        text = { Text(\"Settings\") },\n        onClick = { /* Handle settings! */ },\n        leadingIcon = {\n            Icon(\n                Icons.Outlined.Settings,\n                contentDescription = null\n            )\n        })\n}\n```\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* Options for announcements below depend on framework and versions. Announcement order can vary.\n* \"Open navigation drawer, button, double tap to activate\"\n* \"More options, button, double tap to activate\"\n* \"Open main menu, button, double tap to activate\"\n* \"More options button, disabled\" (disabled state)",

If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n    * The menu's title will overwrite the menu's `accessibilityLabel`.\n  * If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the menu's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n  * If menu item has icon(s), hide the icon(s) from VoiceOver by using view modifier `accessibilityHidden(true)`.\n\n### Role\n\n* When using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded. Otherwise in native app controls, they are automatically assigned.\n\n* Since menu items are interactive, it must be indicated to the user that they are interactive such as indicating that it is a button or it can be double-tapped to be selected.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Use `UIMenu`\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Use native app `Menu` view\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Each menu item and its children are grouped together\n\n* Ensure logical reading order\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n    * If frame does not exist due to custom menu, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n      * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Native app `Menu` views are accessible by default\n  * If necessary, use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n### State\n\n* In the case of expandable menus, state of the menu must be announced (i.e. expands/collapses, opens/closes). Add logic and announcements to the programmatic name for the state.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * If applicable, menu items should be announced whether they are selected/unselected, in the cases of radio buttons or checkboxes.\n  * For enabled menu items: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled menu items: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the menu item to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the menu item.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * If applicable, menu items should be announced whether they are selected/unselected, in the cases of radio buttons or checkboxes.\n  * For selected menu items, use `accessibilityAddTraits(.isSelected)`.\n  * For disabled menu items, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* Focus should be confined within the menu, which can include the button that opened it, if content underneath is hidden.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* When a menu is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element\n\n* An invisible close button can be implemented to close the menu. Ensure this button is in the swipe order, if implemented.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* Options for announcements below depend on framework and versions. Announcement order can vary. \"Menu\" in label is optional, but recommended.\n* \"Label menu, button\"\n* \"Label, button\" (without recommended \"menu\" announcement)\n* \"Label menu, dimmed, button\" (disabled state)\n* \"Dismiss context menu, button\" (Invisible button in swipe past the last item in menu)",

If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.\n* Placeholder text is NOT the programmatic name.\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n  * The radio button's title will overwrite its `accessibilityLabel`.\n* If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the radio button's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n  * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n* To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n* To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* By default, the visible label of a radio group is the accessibility label of that radio group\n  * The visible label of each radio button within a radio group is the accessibility label of that radio button\n* If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)` and assign to the radio group and/or individual radio buttons accordingly.\n\n### Role\n\n* When using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* Since there is no native radio button in UIKit, you can implement a custom radio button by using `UIButton`, `UISwitch`, `UIControl`, or another class.\n* If necessary, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.button`. Be sure to set the accessibility value to either \"Selected\"/\"Checked\" or \"Unselected\"/\"Unchecked\" to indicate that this control behaves as a radio button.\n* An alternative to setting the accessibility trait to `.button` is removing and hiding the accessibility trait using `accessibilityTraits.remove(:)`. Then, append \", Radio Button\" or \", Button\" to the programmatic name\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* Use a native `Picker` view with `.pickerStyle(.radioGroup)`\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with radio button, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the radio button.\n* Group the units such that the label, role, and state of the radio button is announced in a single announcement.\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n* Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n  * If frame does not exist, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n    * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n* If the tap gesture is removed due to grouping logic, restore the tap gesture functionality using bindings to bind the tap gesture of the container with the state of the checkbox.\n\n### State\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* For checked state: Set `accessibilityValue` to \"Selected\" or \"Checked\"\n* For unchecked state: Optionally, set `accessibilityValue` to \"Unselected\" or \"Unchecked\"\n* For enabled state: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n* For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n  * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* For checked state, if necessary: Set accessibility value to \"Selected\" or \"Checked\" with `accessibility(:)`\n* For unchecked state, if necessary: Set accessibility value to \"Unselected\" or \"Unchecked\" with `accessibilityValue(:)`\n* For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n* When a bottom navigation bar element is activated, the next screen's initial focus should stay in the bottom navigation bar.\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n  * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n* Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n* `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n* If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* \"button\" in announcements below comes from the accessibility services most of the time when a native component is used, not from the label. Options for announcements below depend on framework and versions. Announcement order can vary.\n* \"Label, button\"\n* \"Label, button, selected\" (selected state)\n* \"Label, dimmed, button\" (disabled state)",

          "androidDeveloperNotes": "### General Notes\n\n* There is no specific native component for Reordering rows in Android. The experience is simply tap with three fingers to show custom actions (with screen reader on), double tap Actions and choose 1) Move down, 2) Move up, 3) Move to bottom, 4) Move to top or 5) Remove.\n* These are implemented as buttons. Please see the Button component for guidance.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes needs focus management\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API\n  * `android:focusable`\n  * `android=clickable`\n  * Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`\n  * `nextFocusDown`\n  * `nextFocusUp`\n  * `nextFocusRight`\n  * `nextFocusLeft`\n  * `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)\n  * To hide controls: `importantForAccessibility=false`\n  * For a `ViewGroup`, set `screenReaderFocusable=true` and each inner object’s attribute to keyboard focus (`focusable=false`)\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable\n  * `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with FocusRequesters to define focus order\n  * `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state\n  * `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views\n  * Example: To customize the focus events\n    * step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`\n    * step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`\n    * focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end\n    * step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus\n\n### Custom Accessibility Action\n\n* When UI elements are customized and coded to look like a specific component say button, to ensure that name, role, state and action are all intact might need to update accessibility service and semantics.\n\n* Disclaimer: This customization would not be needed unless it is required to modify/add gestures or actions.\n\n* The Button class by default supplies all the necessary semantics to make it fully accessible.\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * step 1: Create an accessibility service\n  * step 2: Add the `FLAG_REQUEST_ACCESSIBILITY_BUTTON` flag in an AccessibilityServiceInfo object's `android:accessibilityFlags` attribute\n  * step 3: To have a custom service register for the button's custom action callbacks, use `registerAccessibilityButtonCallback()`\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * List of custom accessibility actions can be defined relatively easily in compose compared to Views using customActions.\n  * Example: `modifier = Modifier.semantics { customActions = listOf(CustomAccessibilityAction(label = \"\", action = { true }))}`\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* \"Actions available. Please tap with three fingers to view\" (Brings the TalkBack menu into view)\n* \"TalkBack menu.

Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the \\_component to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the search field.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For selected, use `accessibilityAddTraits(.isSelected)`.\n  * For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* \"Search, Search field, double tap to edit\" (Name, role, hint)\n* \"Auto search results below\" (Added when auto-populated search results are shown - optional)",

Announcement: \"disabled\"\n  * Selected: Announced as \"selected\"\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * Active: default state is active and enabled. Use `Tab(enabled = true)` to specify explicitly\n  * Disabled: `Tab(enabled = false)` announces as \"disabled\"\n  * Alternatively can use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { disabled() }` to announce as \"disabled\"\n  * Use `Tab(selected = <condition logic>)` to define selected state\n\n### Focus\n\n* Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes needs focus management\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API\n  * `android:focusable`\n  * `android=clickable`\n  * Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`\n  * `nextFocusDown`\n  * `nextFocusUp`\n  * `nextFocusRight`\n  * `nextFocusLeft`\n  * `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)\n  * To hide controls: `importantForAccessibility=false`\n  * For a `ViewGroup`, set `screenReaderFocusable=true` and each inner object’s attribute to keyboard focus (`focusable=false`)\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable\n  * `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with FocusRequesters to define focus order\n  * `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state\n  * `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views\n  * Example: To customize the focus events\n    * step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`\n    * step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`\n    * focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end\n    * step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus\n\n### Code Example\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n```java\nvar tabIndex by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }\nval titles = listOf(\"Tab 1\", \"Tab 2\", \"Tab 3\")\nColumn {\n    TabRow(selectedTabIndex = tabIndex) {\n        titles.forEachIndexed { index, title ->\n            Tab(\n                selected = tabIndex == index,\n                onClick = { tabIndex = index },\n                text = { Text(text = title) }\n            )\n        }\n    }\n    Box(modifier = Modifier\n        .fillMaxWidth()\n        .background(MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background)) {\n        Text(\n            modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.Center),\n            text = \"Tab ${tabIndex + 1} selected\",\n            style = MaterialTheme.typography.titleMedium,\n            color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* Options for announcements below depend on device framework and versions.

If a sheet does not cover other content, the screen reader can move out of it\n* Swipe anywhere on the screen dismisses the sheet\n* A grabber at the top of the sheet is used to expand/collapse if needed. When implemented, the initial focus is on the grabber\n* A grabber expands/collapses the sheet to cover half the screen or the whole screen. Even though two finger swipe will expand the sheet, the user has to start the swipe with fingers on the drawer, which may be a challenge to those who cannot see the screen. Keyboard users would not be able to expand the sheet without the grabber\n\n### Name\n\n* Name describes the purpose of the control\n\n* Ensure that the button that activates the sheet has a programmatic name. The sheet does not have one as it is implied by the button's programmatic name.\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * `android:text` XML attribute\n  * Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name, depending on type of view and for elements (icons) without a visible label\n  * `contentDescription` overrides `android:text`\n  * Use `labelFor` attribute to associate the visible label with the control\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * Compose uses semantics properties to pass information to accessibility services.\n  * The built-in Button composable will fill the semantics properties with information inferred from the composable by default.\n  * Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name to override the default visible label of the button text.\n  * Example specification of contentDescription in compose: `modifier = Modifier.semantics { contentDescription = \"\" }`\n\n### Role\n\n* When not using native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * `ModalBottomSheet`\n  * Grabber announces as \"double tap to activate\"\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * `ModalBottomSheet`\n  * `BottomSheetScaffold`\n  * When use the drag handle on top of the sheet from the native component then it will be announced as \"collapse drag handle\" with actions available (three fingers tapping to view). With no drag handle designed UI, a close button is required to be displayed and have the init focus whenever the sheet is triggered and showing.\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group elements together logically to better understand the context of the screen\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * `ViewGroup`\n  * Set the container object's `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false. In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement.\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true) {}` is equivalent to `importantForAccessibility` when compared to android views\n  * `FocusRequester.createRefs()` helps to request focus to inner elements with in the group\n\n### State\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * Grabber, if any, announces as expands/collapses\n  * Active: `android:enabled=true`\n  * Disabled: `android:enabled=false`.

          "iosDeveloperNotes": "### General Notes\n\n* A sheet helps people perform a distinct task that’s related to the parent view without taking them away from their current context\n* Use native elements when at all possible vs a custom element, as it will handle expected behavior without additional development effort\n* Most sheets appear as a modal that partially covers the underlying content\n* The screen reader is usually confined in the sheet/drawer if it covers underlining content. If a sheet does not cover other content, the screen reader can move out of it\n* Ensure there is a way to collapse or close the sheet for the screen reader if covering other content. Initial focus is to an invisible dismiss button in later versions\n* A grabber/card controller is used for sheets that expand/collapse. When implemented, the initial focus can be on the grabber, then the next swipe focus is moved to the invisible dismiss button or close X.\n* A card controller button expands/collapses the sheet to cover half the screen or the whole screen. After expanding or collapsing, only the name and state gets announced, not the full announcement\n* Keyboard users would not be able to expand the sheet without the grabber\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control.\n\n* Ensure that the button that activates the sheet has a programmatic name. The sheet does not have its own programmatic name as it is implied by the button's programmatic name.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Set the programmatic name of the button that activates the sheet.\n  * You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n    * The button’s title will overwrite the button’s `accessibilityLabel`.\n  * If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the triggering button's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Set the programmatic name of the button that activates the sheet.\n  * If there is no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n  * If button has icon(s), hide the icon(s) from VoiceOver by using view modifier `accessibilityHidden(true)`.\n\n### Role\n\n* Assign a role to the button that activates the sheet\n\n* The role of the sheet is implied when the sheet opens, and the initial focus lands on the invisible dismiss button (or sheet grabber, if it exists).\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Use `UIButton` for the button that activates the sheet.\n  * Use `UISheetPresentationController` to implement the sheet.\n  * If necessary, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.button` for the button that activates the sheet.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Use native `Button` view for the button that activates the sheet\n  * Use native `sheet` view modifier for implementation of the sheet\n  * If necessary, use view modifier `accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)` to assign the role for the button that activates the sheet.\n  * If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits.\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group elements together logically to better understand the context of the screen\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n    * If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n      * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n### State\n\n* The state of the sheet is implied when the sheet opens, and the initial focus lands on the invisible dismiss button.\n\n* For a sheet with adjustable height, the action to increase sheet height or decrease sheet height must be announced when the user is interacting with the sheet grabber/card controller.\n\n* The accessibility label or value must be updated with each interaction with the sheet grabber/card controller to adjust the sheet height.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * For enabled state of the button that activates the sheet: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled state of the button that activates the sheet: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n* The open and closed state of the sheet is implied when the user's initial focus is on the invisible dismiss button (or sheet grabber, if it exists), and when the user closes the sheet with the invisible dismiss button or developer-implemented close button, if it exists.\n\n* For disabled state of the button that activates the sheet, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* When the sheet is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* Initial focus should land on the sheet grabber, if it exists. Then, the invisible dismiss button. Then, the developer-implemented close button, if it exists.\n\n* If the sheet grabber does not exist, the initial focus should land on the invisible dismiss button, and then the implemented close button.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter - `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* Announcement order can vary.\n* \"Double tap to dismiss pop-up window, button\" (Invisible dismiss button- later versions)\n* \"Close, button\" (If Close X is available)\n* \"Card controller, minimized, button, adjust the size of the card overlaying screen\" (When focus is on the card controller in minimized to go to half screen)\n* \"Card controller, half screen, button, adjust the size of the card overlaying screen\" (When focus is on the card controller in half screen to go to full screen)\n* \"Card controller, full screen, button, adjust the size of the card overlaying screen\" (When focus is on the card controller in full screen to minimize)",

If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Set the visible label with `setTitle()`. Note: this will overwrite the button’s `accessibilityLabel`.\n  * If a visible label is not applicable, set the button's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector.\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`.\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * `TextField` has a built-in label parameter, but it is inside the field itself, which may not be ideal for some use cases. In this case, you may create a separate label and combine it with the `TextField` to create a new accessibility element. Then, apply the programmatic name with `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n  * If there is no built-in label parameter, such as with `TextEditor`, combine the separate label with the `TextEditor` into a new accessibility element, and apply the programmatic name with `accessibilityLabel(_:)` to the entire element as a whole.\n\n### Role\n\nWhen using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Use `UITextField`\n  * If necessary, for a custom control, append the role to the programmatic name or accessibility value\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Use native `TextField` or `TextEditor` view\n  * If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits.\n\n### Groupings\n\nGroup the visible label with the text input field, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the field.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to `false`.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view.

This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new `accessibilityElement`.\n\n### State\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`.\n    * Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* When the date picker is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples (Contacts - date)\n\n* “Add birthday, button\" (button name and role that opens picker)\n* Often, \"collapsed or expanded\" states are added to the button that opens the picker\n* \"February, picker item, adjustable, swipe up or down with one finger to adjust the value\" (focus is on first picker item or previously selected item)\n  * Native pickers do not always show a \"Done\" button on the keyboard. So, swiping backwards to edit another field closes the picker",

If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.\n\n* When naming a switch, do not add \"switch\" or \"button\" to the programmatic name.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n    * The switch's title will overwrite its `accessibilityLabel`.\n  * If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the switch's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n  * If table row of switch has icon(s), hide the icon(s) from VoiceOver by using view modifier `accessibilityHidden(true)`.\n\n### Role\n\n* When using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Use `UIButton` or `UISwitch`\n  * If necessary, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.button`\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Use native `Toggle` view\n  * Native behavior does not announce role, but the role is implied by announcing the current state\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with switch, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the switch.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n    * If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n      * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n### State\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * For checked state: Set `accessibilityValue` to \"On\"\n    * For unchecked state: Optionally, set `accessibilityValue` to \"Off\"\n  * For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * By default, the `Toggle` view announces \"On\" or \"Off\"\n  * For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* Screen reader focus should be around the entire tablerow/blade when there is one interactive element (switch)\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Focus should be around the entire row that has the switch\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Focus should be around the entire row that has the switch\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* “Label, off, double tap to toggle setting” (On or off)\n* “Label, off, switch button, double tap to toggle setting” (On or off)\n* “Label, dimmed, switch button, off” (Disabled state)",

          "iosDeveloperNotes": "### General Notes\n\n* Modal dialogs draw attention to an important, narrowly scoped task, usually appearing over an existing screen\n* Options to close the modal for the screen reader user:\n  * An invisible close button announced for the screen reader only\n  * A close button\n  * A Call To Action (CTA) that navigates the user and closes the modal\n* Tapping outside the modal to close **cannot** be the only option for screen reader users when the modal covers other content\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of any interactive element in the modal or the title of the modal\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognition\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* The visible label for any interactive element is the programmatic name for it.\n* If a visible label is not applicable in your case, set the modal's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n  * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n* To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n* To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* The visible label for any interactive element is the programmatic name for it\n* If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`\n\n### Role\n\n* Required: Screen reader user is confined inside the modal, communicating a modal is present\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* Set the `modalPresentationStyle` of the `UIViewController` to a `UIModalPresentationStyle` of your choice\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* Use view modifier for modal, such as `.sheet`, `.fullScreenCover`, `.popover`. Apply view modifiers to adjust the size of the modal accordingly.\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group content to minimize swipes and give context to the user\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* Since a modal is a presentation of another view, follow logical grouping and reading order within the view.\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n* If frame does not exist due to custom alert, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n  * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n* Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n* Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* Since a modal is a presentation of another view, follow logical grouping and reading order within the view.\n* Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n### State\n\n* Modals that may have an open/close or expands/collapses state must be announced. Add logic and announcement to the programmatic name for the state\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* When the modal appears, the initial focus on the Close button will imply to the user that they are in a modal.\n* For disabled content within the modal: Set the content's `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* When the modal appears, the initial focus on the Close button will imply to the user that they are in a modal.\n* For disabled content, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the default focus functionality of the modal\n* The screen reader focus **must** be confined within the alert or modal. When the modal appears, the initial focus should be to a logical place or to where the default focus is for the device within the modal.\n* Within the modal, ensure the content is following logical reading order. Follow suggested accessibility guidance for content containing buttons, links, etc.\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n  * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n* Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n* `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n* If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Modal announcements\n\nInitial focus areas:\n\n* Close button \"Close, button\" or\n* Invisible button at the top of the screen default announcement: \"Double tap to close modal\"",

          "developerNotes": "## Developer Notes\n\n1. **General requirements**\n\n   The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide very specific color contrast requirements:\n\n   * Normal text (up to 18pt/24px or 14pt/18.5px if bold) must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 between the text color and background color.\n   * Large text (at least 18pt/24px or 14pt/18.5px if bold) must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the text color and background color.\n   * Meaningful graphics, user interface components and their various states, as well as focus indicators must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with the background color.\n   * **Exceptions:** Logos, incidental or decorative text and graphics, and disabled controls do not need to meet color contrast requirements.\n\n2. **How to test**\n\n   ### Automated scanning\n\n   Automated scanning tools, such as [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/), [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/), or [Deque's Axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/blog/axe-devtools-extension-update-new-color-contrast-analyzer/) are a great starting point for color contrast testing. All of these tools can run page scans that quickly generate reports identifying color contrast issues. Scans are:\n\n   * **Good** at identifying simple issues like solid colored text on solid colored backgrounds that do not meet contrast ratios.\n   * **Bad** at identifying anything more complex like text on background images, gradients, and different states for user interface components (like hover or focus) that do not meet contrast ratios.\n\n   ### Manual testing\n\n   Automated scanning must be complemented with a manual review of the page.\n\n   #### Getting started\n\n   * Open DevTools in your browser window (<span class=\"keyboard-key\">F12</span>)\n   * Right-click and select \"Inspect\" on the different color combinations that you see as you move from the top of the page on down\n   * Find the hexadecimal color values in the \"Styles\" tab of your DevTools window (see example image below)\n   * Enter the hex values into a contrast checking tool (like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) or [Deque's Color Contrast Analyzer](https://dequeuniversity.com/color-contrast)) to see if they meet contrast requirements.\n\n    <example>\n      <img\n      src=\"/media/images/how-to-test/color-contrast-hex-codes-for-contrast.png\"\n      alt=\"Inspecting an element in chrome to find hex codes\">\n    </example>\n\n   #### Hover to inspect\n\n   * Chrome has an \"Inspect Element by Mouse\" DevTools feature that is useful for checking contrast\n   * Click the button located in the upper left-hand corner of your DevTools window to enable the feature\n   * Hover over elements on the page with your cursor\n   * A popup will appear that often indicates whether the element passes contrast by displaying a green check mark within a circle (see example image below)\n\n    <example>\n      <img\n      src=\"/media/images/how-to-test/color-contrast-chrome-contrast-inspector.png\"\n    alt=\"using Chrome's inspect element by mouse feature to see if element meets contrast requirements\">\n    </example>\n\n   #### Background images and gradients\n\n   * Identify instances of text and user interface elements that sit on top of background images or color gradients\n   * Use a color picker tool to get representative hex codes from the background\n   * In Chrome's DevTools, under the \"Styles\" tab you can click on any of the color boxes to bring up the Color Picker popup\n   * Within the popup, activate the eyedropper icon\n   * Hover over the desired area on the background image with your cursor and click\n   * The hex value will be displayed in the Color Picker (see example image below)\n\n    <example>\n      <img\n    src=\"/media/images/how-to-test/color-contrast-chrome-color-picker.png\"\n    alt=\"using Chrome's color picker and eyedropper tool to get hex codes for background images.\">\n    </example>\n\n   #### State changes\n\n   * Identify interactive elements that change color based on their states, such as focus or hover\n   * Ensure that the state changes meet contrast requirements\n   * You can force some state changes to persist, which makes them easier to check\n   * Inspect the desired element\n   * In Chrome's DevTools, under the \"Styles\" tab, activate the \":hov\" toggle button\n   * Select the checkbox with desired state\n   * This will force a persistent state and allow you to check for contrast on the element (see example image below)\n\n    <example>\n      <img\n        src=\"/media/images/how-to-test/color-contrast-set-hover-state.png\"\n        alt=\"using Chrome's DevTools to force hover state on a link.\">\n    </example>\n\n   ### Browsers\n\n   * Any major browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) is acceptable for color contrast testing.\n\n3. **What to test for**\n\n    <div class=\"how-to-test-checklist-item\">\n      <h3>✓ Ensure text has sufficient contrast to the background color</h3>\n      <table class=\"column-2\">\n        <thead>\n          <tr>\n            <th scope=\"col\">Pass</th>\n            <th scope=\"col\">Fail</th>\n          </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr>\n            <td><p>This text passes contrast</p></td>\n            <td><p style=\"color:#0FE000\">This text does NOT pass contrast</p></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td><p style=\"color:#009999;

Keyboard and screen reader users should be able focus on each input field with their tab key, enter the relevant information, and tab away.\n\n   <example>\n   <label for=\"best-nato-letter\">\n     The best NATO letter is:\n   </label>\n   <input type=\"text\" id=\"best-nato-letter\" aria-describedby=\"best-nato-letter-hint\">\n\n   <div class=\"hint\" id=\"best-nato-letter-hint\">\n     Example: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie\n   </div>\n   </example>\n\n2. **Checkboxes**\n\n   Checkboxes allow users to select one or more options from a list. Keyboard and screen reader users should be able to focus on each checkbox field with their tab key and use the enter or space keys to select or unselect the item.\n\n   <example>\n   <fieldset>\n     <legend>Choose your favorite NATO letters:</legend>\n\n     <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"alphaCheckbox\">\n     <label for=\"alphaCheckbox\">Alpha</label>\n\n     <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"bravoCheckbox\">\n     <label for=\"bravoCheckbox\">Bravo</label>\n\n     <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"charlieCheckbox\" checked=\"\">\n     <label for=\"charlieCheckbox\">Charlie</label>\n   </fieldset>\n   </example>\n\n3. **Radio Buttons**\n\n   Radio buttons allow users to select a single option from a list. Only one radio button in a group should be be selectable at a time. Keyboard and screen reader users should be able to focus on the group of radio buttons using the tab key. Arrow keys move focus between each radio option. Options can be automatically selected as they receive focus with the arrow keys, or they can be selected using the space key. Pressing tab navigates aways from the radio group.\n\n   <example>\n      <fieldset>\n        <legend>\n          Choose a fruit\n        </legend>\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"fruit\" id=\"appleRadio\">\n        <label for=\"appleRadio\">Apple</label>\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"fruit\" id=\"bananaRadio\">\n        <label for=\"bananaRadio\">Banana</label>\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"fruit\" id=\"cherryRadio\" checked=\"\">\n        <label for=\"cherryRadio\">Cherry</label>\n      </fieldset>\n   </example>\n\n4. **Select Fields**\n\n   Select fields allow users to select one or more options from an expandable list of options. Keyboard and screen reader users should be able to focus on the select using their tab key. The space key expands the list of options, the arrow keys traverse the options, and the space or enter keys make a selection. Escape collapses the list.\n\n   <example>\n      <label for=\"nato\">\n        Select a Nato phonetic Letter\n      </label>\n      <select id=\"nato\">\n        <option value=\"None\" selected=\"\" disabled=\"\">Select a letter</option>\n        <option value=\"A\">Alpha</option>\n        <option value=\"B\">Bravo</option>\n        <option value=\"C\">Charlie</option>\n      </select>\n

These different types of images have different testing steps.\n\n   * **Informative Images:** These are visuals like pictures, photos, and illustrations that convey important information or concepts. To make them accessible, we need to include a brief description in text form that captures the key content of the image.\n\n   * **Decorative Images:** Sometimes, images are used purely for aesthetic purposes and don't convey meaningful information. In such cases, it's best to provide an empty text alternative `alt=\"\"` to indicate that the image serves a decorative role and doesn't require a description.\n\n   * **Functional Images:** Images that serve as links or buttons should have text alternatives that describe their function rather than just their appearance. For example, if you have an image of a printer icon that initiates a printing action, the alt text should convey this functionality, like \"Print.\"\n\n   * **Images of Text:** Images of text should be avoided whenever possible. In fact, some images of text can violate [WCAG 1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/images-of-text.html). However, if you must use images with text, ensure that the alt text contains the exact same words as the text within the image to maintain consistency.\n\n   * **Complex Images such as Graphs and Diagrams:** When using images to present complex data or detailed information, it's crucial to provide a comprehensive text description that conveys all the data and details found in the image. This allows individuals who cannot see the image to still access and understand its content.\n\n2. **How to test**\n\n   ### Automated Testing\n\n   Automated scanning tools, such as [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/), [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/), or [Deque's Axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/blog/axe-devtools-extension-update-new-color-contrast-analyzer/) are a great starting point for image testing. All of these tools can run page scans that quickly generate reports identifying some image issues. Scans are:\n\n   * <strong>Good</strong> at identifying simple issues like missing <code>alt</code> attributes on images or empty alt attributes on functional images.\n   * <strong>Bad</strong> at identifying issues related to alternative text quality or whether or not an image should be marked as decorative and hidden from screen readers.\n\n   ### Manual testing\n\n   Automated scanning must be complemented with a manual review of the page. Manual image testing can test for alt text quality, ensuring that decorative images are hidden from assistive technology, all text found in images of text are present in alt text, and that functional images have the appropriate alt text.\n\n   #### <strong>Getting started</strong>\n\n   * Open Chrome DevTools in your browser window <span class=\"keyboard-key\">F12</span>\n   * Right-click and select \"Inspect\" on the image in the page you want to test.\n\n3. **Informative Images**\n\n   * Check that the image owns an <code>alt</code> attribute.\n   * Ensure that the <code>alt</code> attribute is present is not empty.\n   * Ensure that the alt attribute is present is not empty, such as <code>alt</code> or <code>alt=\"\"</code>\n   * The <code>alt</code> attribute value / description of the image should be accurate and succinct. The image alternative should not consist of information that duplicates nearby text content.\n\n   <img\n   src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-images-meaningful-1.png\"\n   alt=\"Inspecting an image in DevTools to check alt text, meaningful image\"/>\n\n   ### IMG\n\n   ```html\n   <img alt=\"A rear view of the iPhone 15 Pro in silver, along with a front view of the iPhone 15 Pro Max in silver.\" src=\"../iphone.png\" ... >\n   ```\n\n   ### SVG\n\n   Some images are implemented using inline <code>SVG</code>. Text alernatives for these images can be defined by use of <code>role=\"img\"</code> and <code>aria-label=\"I am the alt text\"</code>. The <code>alt</code> attribute should not be on an element whose <code>role</code> is <code>role=\"img\"</code> this is instead handled by <code>aria-label</code>.\n\n   ```html\n   <svg role=\"img\" aria-label=\"I am the alt text\">...</svg>\n   ```\n\n4. **Decorative Images**\n\n   * Ensure that the <code>alt</code> attribute is present and owns an empty or null value. <code>alt=\"\"</code>.\n   * <strong>Note:</strong> <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code> is not needed if an image has an empty or null alt attribute value <code>alt=\"\"</code>.\n\n    <img src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-images-decorative-1.png\" alt=\"Inspecting an image in DevTools to check alt text, decorative image\">\n\n   ```html\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"../some-image.png\" ...>\n   ```\n\n5. **Functional Images**\n\n   * Ensure the <code>alt</code> attribute is present and owns a value that includes <strong>all</strong> of the text found in the image.\n   * Functional images are typically links or buttons so the alt text should define the purpose of the link instead of describing the image.\n\n    <img src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-images-functional.png\" alt=\"Inspecting an image in DevTools to check alt text, functional image\">\n\n   * **Note:** Functional images can have empty or null alt attribute values <code>alt=\"\"</code> if the text alternative is conveyed in the parent control's label. For example, <code>aria-label=\"Download on the Apple App Store\"</code>.\n\n   ```html\n   <button aria-label=\"Download on the Apple App Store\">\n       <img src=\"apple.png\" alt=\"\">\n   </button>\n   ```\n\n6. **Images of Text**\n\n   * Sometimes text can't be easily created with HTML and CSS and an image must contain text. In this case, ensure the <code>alt</code> attribute is present and owns a value that includes <strong>all</strong> of the text found in the image.\n   * Typically, the text is the most important part of the image. There is no need for the image itself to be described unless it adds value to the content of the page.\n   * Consider logging a defect for [WCAG 1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/images-of-text.html) if it seems like there might be a viable workaround to add real text to the page vs. an image of text.\n\n    <img src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-test-images-text.png\" alt=\"Inspecting an image in DevTools to check alt text, image of text example\">\n\n   ```html\n   <img src=\"apple-iphone-15-pro.png\" alt=\"Titanium Apple iPhone 15 Pro\">\n   ```\n\n7. **Complex Images**\n\n   * Data visualizations, charts, and graphs can be very difficult to author alternative text for. Some features like charts and graphs may not be accessible themselves but there can be text alternatives nearby that can act as an accessible alternative.\n   * For complex images that are <code>img</code> elements, ensure that the image has an <code>alt</code> attribute and that its value communicates the general purpose of the image. This alt text does not need to contain all of the visual information as that may be too long for an appropriate alt text value. If the alt text does not describe all content in the image ensure there is content nearby, or linked to, that does contain all of the visual information in text form.\n   * For charts and graphs, these features are typically not 100% accessible. Ensure there is content nearby, or linked to, that does contain all of the visual information in text form. For example, an accessible Excel download or HTML Table presenting the key visual information from the content found in the chart.\n   * <strong>Note:</strong> It is important that all text alternatives to complex images must be in an accessible format to qualify as an accessible alternative.\n\n    <img src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-test-images-complex-data.png\" alt=\"Complex chart with nearby HTML table for text alternative\">\n\n   ```html\n   <img src=\"/assets/images/examples/how-to-test-images-complex-data.png\" alt=\"Complex chart with nearby HTML table for text alternative\">\n\n   <table>\n       <caption>NASDAQ: TMUS</caption>\n       <tr>\n       <th>Date</th>\n       <th>Price</th>\n       <!-- ... -->\n       </tr>\n       <tr>\n       <td>January 10</td>\n       <td>122.20</td>\n       <!-- ... -->\n       </tr>\n   </table>\n   ```\n\n8. **What to test for**\n\n    <div class=\"how-to-test-checklist-item\">\n    <h3>✓ Ensure meaningful images have alt text</h3>\n    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The passing example has alt text that matches the text found in the image.

For example, buttons and links. |\n   | Shift + Tab | Moves in reverse through the interface focusing on elements that are focusable.                      |\n   | Enter       | Active links and buttons.                                                                            |\n   | Spacebar    | Activates buttons and interacts with form elements.                                                  |\n   | Escape      | Should close or dismiss widgets like dialogs.                                                        |\n\n3. **What to test for**\n\n   ✓ **Ensure all mouse functionality is present for keyboard**\n\n   Identify functionality within the experience that can be operated with a mouse or pointing device. Ensure this content can be accessed with they keyboard alone.\n\n   ✓ **Ensure there is a highly visible visual indication of keyboard focus**\n\n   Keyboard users need to understand where they are in the interface at all times. The visual indication of keyboard focus (focus ring) should be highly visible and have a color contrast ratio of 3:1 against the background. Verify that overlap items (e.g. cookie banners, sticky footers, sticky headers, and non-modal dialogs) do not obscure the visual indicator.\n\n   ✓ **Ensure that there are no keyboard traps**\n\n   Ensure that while navigating the experience, you do not encounter situations where you are not able to move forward or backward with the keyboard alone.\n\n   ✓ **Verify that the focus order is logical**\n\n   In an English-based experience, keyboard focus should move top-to-bottom and left-to-right in a logical order. Ensure focus is not jumping around the experience in a way that makes it hard to understand the content.\n\n   ✓ **On focus does not create a change of context**\n\n   Ensure that when an interactive element receives keyboard focus that a change of context is not initiated without warning of such behavoir. An example of change of context is a page load or web form submission.\n\n   ✓ **Test for skip links**\n\n   Where there are large chunks of repeated content, ensure that there are skip links present for keboard users. For example, on a site with a large site navigation system, the first focusable element in the page should be a link that allows users to jump to the main content of the site.\n\n### Video Example\n\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"media/video/how-to-test/how-to-keyboard.webm\" type=\"video/webm\">\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n\n## Related WCAG\n\n* 1.4.11: Non-text Contrast\n* 2.1.1 Keyboard\n* 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap\n* 2.4.3 Focus Order\n* 2.4.7 Focus Visible\n* 3.2.1 On Focus\n\n## Resources\n\n[WebAIM: Keyboard Accessibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/)"

Swipe left navigates backwards.\n   * If custom actions are implemented, swipe up or down with one finger anywhere on the screen to perform action.\n   * Scroll with two fingers for Android\n   * Scroll with three fingers for iOS\n   * Double tap to activate when the link is focused\n   * Activate Rotor or TalkBack menu to access a list of links to activate with double tap. (Only one way of accessing links is required: Focus within screen or in the context menus)\n   * Note: Currently a known bug in iOS – links cannot be accessed from the Rotor using SwiftUI.\n\n   #### Screen reader shortcut one-time setup\n\n   ##### iOS VoiceOver\n\n   1. Open Settings\n   2. Choose Accessibility\n   3. Choose Accessibility Shortcut\n   4. Select VoiceOver\n   5. To start or stop VoiceOver, press the power button three times (no need to go to Settings each time to turn the screen reader on and off)\n\n   ##### TalkBack\n\n   1. Open Settings\n   2. Choose Accessibility\n   3. Choose Advanced Settings\n   4. Choose Volume up and down keys\n   5. Enable the toggle\n   6. To start or stop TalkBack, press both volume keys for 2-3 seconds (no need to go to Settings each time to turn the screen reader on and off)\n\n   ### iOS Rotor and Android TalkBack Menu\n\n   #### iOS Rotor setup\n\n   1. With VoiceOver on, using two fingers on the screen (many prefer to make a pinching-gesture and rotate on the screen), rotate fingers to hear the options available in the rotor\n   2. Keep rotating to cycle through the options, such as “headings”\n   3. With the rotor set to this option, you will be able to ues the single-finger swipe up or down to navigate through all the headings found on the screen. Note: (1) sing the single-finger swipe left or right is still available at any time. (2) Setting the rotor to other options will allow for the single-finger swipe up or down to navigate the user to that respective option.\n\n   #### Android TalkBack Menu (formally the Local Context Menu) setup\n\n   1. Tap once with three-fingers to access the TalkBack Menu\n   2. Actions and Links are the most common options to use, but others such as Activate Links, Expand Accordions, Navigate through a Carousel, and Delete Elements are available, too.\n\n   ##### Lastly, test for enlarged text:\n\n   * Go to Settings on your device and increase text size to 200%\n     * In iOS, with \"Larger Accessibility Sizes\" toggled ON, move the text-size slider to the 9th tick from the left.\n       * Ensure no text in the app is cut off, overlaps, truncates, or disappears\n     * Android, move the slide to the last tick to the right, the \"largest\" or \"Huge\" setting\n   * Ensure functionality works as expected; review accessibility acceptance criteria found on each component's individual page for testing steps\n     * In iOS, Larger headings should adjust to Apple font size guidance\n   * This does not apply to images of text or logos\n   * Text in the top and bottom navigation bars **do not** increase in size\n   * Text in a WebView on iOS does not increase in size\n\n   ###### Developer note for Large Text\n\n   * Ensure containers enlarge as text enlarges (view constraints are set correctly)\n   * Set labels to textwrap\n   * Specify font weight when needed\n   * Specify font size and font scale when needed\n   * Do not disable scrolling\n   * Use preferred fonts for the platform when possible (designers will give the developers the font styles and sizes)\n\n2. **How to test with your BlueTooth External keyboard**\n\n   ### Test with BlueTooth External keyboard\n\n   Test with the BlueTooth external keyboard (without the screen reader turned on).\n\n   #### Setting up your BlueTooth external keyboard\n\n   Pair the external keyboard with your device as you would a computer.\n\n   For iOS setup only:\n\n   1. Open Settings\n   2. Choose Accessibility\n   3. Choose Keyboards\n   4. Toggle on \"Full Keyboard Access\"\n\n   #### Navigating using your BlueTooth external keyboard\n\n   * Turn OFF Screen Reader when testing with keyboard\n   * Pair the external keyboard with the phone as you would a computer\n   * iOS – Turn on Full Keyboard Access toggle in Accessibility settings or keyboard will not work properly\n   * The focus ring for keyboard, which is different from the screen reader focus must be visible. Sometimes, this is just a slight change or shadow.\n\n   ##### How to test with your BlueTooth external keyboard\n\n   * Use tab key OR arrow keys to navigate through the screen\n     * There are other key combinations that are acceptable to use besides Tab, Shift-Tab and Arrow keys. CTRL+Tab is one that is also acceptable.\n   * Only interactive elements must be focused.

          "developerNotes": "## Developer Notes\n\nAccessibility testing is important because it helps to ensure that everyone can use a website or application, regardless of their disability. This includes people who are blind, deaf, have low vision, or have mobility impairments.\n\nTo thoroughly test web accessibility, a combination of manual and automated testing methods are performed against the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Level A and AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). Manual testing involves people navigating the site, using assistive technologies like screen readers or keyboard-only navigation, and verifying if all content is perceivable, operable, understandable. Automated testing utilizes specialized tools to scan for common accessibility issues, such as missing alternative text for images or improper heading structure.\n\nBy combining both approaches, we can identify and address accessibility barriers comprehensively, improving the overall user experience and inclusivity of our digital products.\n\n1. ## Test against MagentaA11y.com\n\n   A good first step is to test against MagentaA11y.com patterns. Each pattern includes a How to Test section, code samples, notes about expected functionality, and clear acceptance criteria.\n\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion\">\n      <h2 class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__heading\">\n      <button class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-fn=\"toggleAccordionState\" aria-controls=\"list\">\n      <span class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline--text\">Example: Toggle Switch</span>\n      </button>\n      </h2>\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__body\" id=\"list\">\n      <h3>Scenario</h3>\n      On the web page you are testing you encounter a toggle switch that does not work with the left and right arrow keys like you believe it should.\n\n      <h3>What to do</h3>\n      To verify if arrow key support is expected for toggles on the web, you can first check MagentaA11y. Locate the <a href=\"https://www.magentaa11y.com/web-criteria/component/toggle-switch\">Toggle Switch</a> component page and review the How to test section. Arrow key support is not mentioned so this is not a requirement for toggle Switch components and so this is not an accessibility issue. \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n2. ## Design System\n\n   If you are testing an experience that is created from a formal design system, you can reference that design system’s documentation. Design systems will provide functional components and detailed information on how components should be implemented and function.\n\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion\">\n      <h2 class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__heading\">\n      <button class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-fn=\"toggleAccordionState\" aria-controls=\"list\">\n      <span class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline--text\">Example: Interactive Table</span>\n      </button>\n      </h2>\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__body\" id=\"list\">\n      <h3>Scenario</h3>\n      You are testing a page that consists of an interactive table. When you send keyboard focus to the table, focus skips the table headers and jumps to the second row. You are not sure if this is a focus order issue.\n\n      <h3>What to do</h3>\n      You know this project uses the brand-new design system, so you check the documentation for the interactive table. You learn that the table is implemented as an ARIA Grid and learn that this is the expected behavior, so this is not an accessibility issue. \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n3. ## Automated testing\n\n   Often, accessibility barriers are related to code issues. Automated testing can quickly detect code-related issues that may create barriers for assistive technology users.\n\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion\">\n      <h2 class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__heading\">\n      <button class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-fn=\"toggleAccordionState\" aria-controls=\"list\">\n      <span class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline--text\">Example: Nested Buttons</span>\n      </button>\n      </h2>\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__body\" id=\"list\">\n      <h3>Scenario</h3>\n      You are testing a button that when activated, presents a list of options. For some reason, the screen reader will not interact with the button correctly. \n\n      <h3>What to do</h3>\n      You have ran some automated accessibility tests and in the results there is an issue identified that indicates the author has nested a button element inside of another button element and that is not only invalid HTML, it is creating the barrier with the screen reader so this is an issue.\n\n   ```html\n   <div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">\n     <button>Click Me</button>\n   </div>\n   ```\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n4. ## Code Inspection\n\n   Automated testing does not catch everything. You can have code that is “correct” or valid and it can still create accessibility issues. Manual inpsection of code can often identify what the issue is.\n\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion\">\n      <h2 class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__heading\">\n      <button class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-fn=\"toggleAccordionState\" aria-controls=\"list\">\n      <span class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline--text\">Example: Nested Dialogs</span>\n      </button>\n      </h2>\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__body\" id=\"list\">\n      <h3>Scenario</h3>\n      On the web page you are testing you encounter a dialog that is not being announced by the NVDA screen reader for some reason.\n\n      <h3>What to do</h3>\n      After opening Chrome DevTools and inspecting the code, you notice higher up in the DOM that there is a dialog element nested inside of another dialog element. While this may be valid HTML, it has created a barrier for NVDA users because it is not a standard implementation of a dialog, so this is an accessibility issue.\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n5. ## HTML Validation\n\n   Code validity and proper use of HTML is an important factor with accessibility. You can use the Nu Html Checker to validate code. You can also reference the HTML Living Standard for guidelines on proper HTML use.\n\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion\">\n      <h2 class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__heading\">\n      <button class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-fn=\"toggleAccordionState\" aria-controls=\"list\">\n      <span class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline--text\">Example: Label not announced</span>\n      </button>\n      </h2>\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__body\" id=\"list\">\n      <h3>Scenario</h3>\n      An ARIA Combobox has a nearby text label, but this label is not announced by the screen reader when the widget receives focus. \n\n      <h3>What to do</h3>\n      Using the Nu Html Checker, validate an isolated fragment of code to see if there are any code validity issues. Improper use of HTML or even spelling errors can cause accessibility barriers. For example, <code>aria-labeledby</code> is misspelled and should be <code>aria-labelledby</code>. Code validation would detect this code issue. \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n6. ## Verify you are correctly using the screen reader or keyboard\n\n   Before you log an issue, make sure that you have tested it correctly. Refer to the MagentaAlly sections on How to test <a href=\"https://www.magentaa11y.com/#/how-to-test-criteria/type/keyboard-&-focus\">Keyboard & focus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.magentaa11y.com/#/how-to-test-criteria/type/screen-readers\">Screen readers</a> for guidance on system settings and methodology.\n\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion\">\n      <h2 class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__heading\">\n      <button class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-fn=\"toggleAccordionState\" aria-controls=\"list\">\n      <span class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline--text\">Example: Unable to navigate with Tab</span>\n      </button>\n      </h2>\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__body\" id=\"list\">\n      <h3>Scenario</h3>\n      You are attempting to test a web page on your Mac with your keyboard, but are unable to focus on elements you think should be focusable with the Tab Key.\n\n      <h3>What to do</h3>\n      On your MacOS, you go into the \"Keyboard\" section of your \"System Settings\" and see that \"Keyboard navigation\" has not been turned on. Once you turn it on, you are able to tab through the page as expected so this is not an issue. \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n7. ## Verify with other screen reader and browser combinations\n\n   Sometimes there are bugs that exist with different screen reader and browser combinations, so it is important to test with several browsers and, ideally, different screen readers.\n\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion\">\n      <h2 class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__heading\">\n      <button class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-fn=\"toggleAccordionState\" aria-controls=\"list\">\n      <span class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline--text\">Example: Accordion not annoucing as expanded</span>\n      </button>\n      </h2>\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__body\" id=\"list\">\n      <h3>Scenario</h3>\n      You are testing a page in Chrome with NVDA. On page load there is an expanded accordion button, but it is not annoucing as expanded with NVDA.\n\n      <h3>What to do</h3>\n      You inspect the code and see the appropriate <code>aria-expanded=\"true\"</code> attribute, so you test the same page in Firefox with NVDA and JAWS, as well as in Safari with VoiceOver. The button is announcing as expected in all environments so you determine there is a bug with NVDA/Chrome and do not need to mark it as an accessibility issue. \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n8. ## Document the accessibility issue\n\n   Make it easy for others to review and fix your issue.\n\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion\">\n      <h2 class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__heading\">\n      <button class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-fn=\"toggleAccordionState\" aria-controls=\"list\">\n      <span class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__headline--text\">Example: Image not announcing</span>\n      </button>\n      </h2>\n      <div class=\"MagentaA11y-accordion__body\" id=\"list\">\n      <h3>Scenario</h3>\n      You discovered an image of a product that is not announcing for screen readers on the home page because it is missing an <code>alt</code> attribute.\n\n      <h3>What to do</h3>\n      You want to clearly capture the exact steps to recreate the issue in your organizations bug tracking system:\n\n      <ul>\n      <li>The URL where the image is located</li>\n      <li>A description of the image and its location on the page</li>\n      <li>The accessibility concern (ex: \"missing <code>alt</code> attribute\")</li>\n      <li>Who it impacts - which users are impacted by the barrier and why</li>\n      <li>A snippet of the corresponding code</li>\n      <li>Screenshots of the images (ensure the screenshot has context - don't crop too tight)</li>\n      <li>A good/fixed snippet of the corresponding code</li>\n      </ul>\n\n   While it is always helpful to provide screenshots, your issue should be written clear enough that they are not needed by someone reading the details of the bug.\n\n      </div>\n      </div>"

Instead, use a keyboard to navigate.\n\n   Utilize the accessibility testing scenarios here on MagentaA11y component and pattern pages for UI expected behavior.\n\n2. ## Screen reader options\n\n   According to the <a href=\"https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey10/\">WebAIM screen reader user survey</a>, the overwhelming **majority of screen reader users are on Windows** machines using software such as: <a href=\"https://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/software/JAWS/\">JAWS (Job Access With Speech)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nvaccess.org/\">NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access)</a>. They are followed in popularity by **Apple's built-in screen reader, VoiceOver**.\n\n   Some browsers work best with certain screen readers and are specifically suggested by operating systems.\n\n   ### NVDA\n\n   NVDA is a free screen reader available for download on Windows computers. For NVDA the recommended browsers are **Chrome, Firefox, or Edge**. Below is a quick-start guide of keyboard shortcuts. If needed, check out this more <a href=\"https://webaim.org/resources/shortcuts/nvda\">expansive list of NVDA keyboard shortcuts from WebAIM</a>.\n\n   #### Getting Started\n\n   Disable “Automatic Say All on page load” in NVDA Settings: Browse Mode. This will increase the conformance of NVDA.\n\n   #### NVDA differences\n\n   * NVDA has 2 modes with different keyboard shortcuts.\n     * Browse (Red focus indicator)\n       * Arrow keys will browse from element to element\n     * Focus (Blue focus indicator)\n       * Arrow keys will only interact with the interactive element in focus\n   * Only reads ~120 characters at at time\n   * Reads “clickable” when it detects a click event listener on an element, even when it’s not clickable. (Note: If the element is not intended to be clickable, this is a defect to be remediated)\n   * Will read a button with `aria-haspopup=\"true\"` as “menu submenu”\n   * Any element in focus like a dialog or section will be read in its entirety\n\n   #### NVDA Basic Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n   <table >\n      <caption class=\"hidden-visually \">NVDA Basic Keyboard Shortcuts</caption>\n      <thead>\n      <tr>\n         <th scope=\"col\" class=\"text-left\">\n            Key\n         </th>\n         <th scope=\"col\" class=\"text-left\">\n            Action\n         </th>\n      </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>\n      <tr>\n         <th scope=\"row\">\n            <span>Control + Alt + N</span>\n         </th>\n         <td>\n            Turn NVDA on\n         </td>\n      </tr>  \n      <tr>\n         <th scope=\"row\">\n            <span>Insert + Q</span>\n         </th>\n         <td>\n            Turn NVDA off\n         </td>\n      </tr>                   \n      <tr>\n         <th scope=\"row\">\n            <span>Arrows</span>\n         </th>\n         <td>\n            Read next or previous item\n         </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n         <th scope=\"row\">\n            <span>Tab</span>\n         </th>\n         <td>\n            Moves through the interface focusing on elements that are focusable.
