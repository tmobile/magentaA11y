Manual testing is not difficult or time consuming once a team understands keyboard interactions.

## 1. Test with the keyboard only

It is crucial to test with the keyboard first, without the screenreader activated.

### Why keyboard is so important

- Keyboard accessibility is prerequisite to screen reader accessibility. 
- Screenreader applications will sometimes cover missing functionality that the sighted keyboard user won't be able to use.

### Devices
- Test with a mobile device and a bluetooth keyboard
- Test with a desktop device and a keyboard

### Browsers
- Any major browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) is acceptable for keyboard testing.

## 2. Test with the mobile screenreader

Many companies have crossed the threshold to a majority of visits being from mobile devices.

### Screenreader browser pairings
- iOS
  - Voiceover + Safari
- Android
  - Talkback + Chrome

## 3. Test with the desktop screenreader

- Not having all three screen readers available doesn't meean you can't test for accessibility.
- Most of the accessibility defects you're likely to encounter will show up in any screen reader.

### Screenreader browser pairings

- PC
  - JAWS + Chrome
  - NVDA + Chrome 
- Mac
  - Voiceover + Safari
