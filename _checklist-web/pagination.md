## Code examples

### Use semantic HTML
This semantic HTML contains all accessibility features by default.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/nav-pagination.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/nav-pagination.html %}
</example>
{:/}

## Developer notes

### Name

- Use `aria-label="Pagination"` when there is not a visible nav title.
  - `aria-describedby="title-id"` can be used when the nav title is a visible heading.
- Use `aria-label="Page X"` for each entry link.

### Role

- Identifies itself as navigation
- Use `role="navigation"` when it's not possible to use `<nav>`. 
- **DO NOT** add menu or option roles with arrow key event listeners unless you're building an actual application like Gmail.

### State

- Use `aria-current="page"` on the current page item.
