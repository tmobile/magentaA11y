## iOS

### Developer notes
- A strike-through is a style that indicates something is removed, deleted, unavailable or canceled, but the original text is meaningful enough and remains visible
- The strike-through must not be ignored by the screen reader.  Adding an accessibility label to the strike-through text will convey its meaning.  This can be done by grouping the new price with the strike-through price and strike-through accessibility label and announce together.
  
### Groupings
- Group strike-through text with the strike-through accessibility label and updated text

### Groupings
- **UIKit**
  1. Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.
  2. Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.
  - If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.
    - You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).
  - Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.
  - Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.
- **SwiftUI**
  - Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement. 

### Focus
- Use the device's default focus functionality. 

- **UIKit**
  - If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`
    - **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.
  - Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.
  - To move screenreader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.
  - To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.
  - `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements. 


- **SwiftUI**
  - For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.
    - Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.
    - Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.
  - If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.

### Announcement examples
- "Amount was $57 and is now $27"  (Strike-through on $57 grouped with updated price of $27)"

## Android

### Developer notes

### Groupings

- **Android Views**
  - `ViewGroup`
  - Set the container object's `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false. In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement.

- **Jetpack Compose**
  - `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true) {}` is equivalent to `importantForAccessibility` when compared to android views
  - `FocusRequester.createRefs()` helps to request focus to inner elements with in the group

### Focus
- Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus

- **Android Views**
  - `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API
  - `android:focusable`
  - `android=clickable`
  - Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`
  - `nextFocusDown`
  - `nextFocusUp`
  - `nextFocusRight`
  - `nextFocusLeft`
  - `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)
  - To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`
  - To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)
  - To hide controls: `importantForAccessibility=false`
  - For a `ViewGroup`, set `screenReaderFocusable=true` and each inner object’s attribute to keyboard focus (`focusable=false`)

- **Jetpack Compose**
  - `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable
  - `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with FocusRequesters to define focus order
  - `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state
  - `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views
  - Example: To customize the focus events
    - step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`
    - step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`
    - focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end
    - step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus

### Announcement examples 
- "Amount was $57 and is now $27"  (Strike-through on $57 grouped with updated price of $27)"
