00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.840
Let's test this page for keyboard
accessibility.

52aaece0-8030-4a8b-9ea5-a3550b3c05d5-0
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.546
The first thing I'm going to do when the
page loads is hit the tab key,

52aaece0-8030-4a8b-9ea5-a3550b3c05d5-1
00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:12.378
and I can use tab to move forward in the
interface,

52aaece0-8030-4a8b-9ea5-a3550b3c05d5-2
00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:16.800
and I can use Shift tab to move backwards
in the interface.

69252ee5-4a6a-4e00-81d4-c9fe329dee58-0
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.040
As I tab around this main navigation,
you may notice that there's a highly

69252ee5-4a6a-4e00-81d4-c9fe329dee58-1
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.800
visible visual indication of keyboard
focus.

12f76f13-8f0e-4a84-a811-36f16f839cda-0
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.200
It's pretty clear where I'm at.

d5ad6c7a-b366-44b2-8648-cfd40d72a47e-0
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.560
That's what we want to see on all
controls.

5ff042c8-ce93-46ed-8bd6-284957acdfda-0
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.760
Needs to be pretty obvious where I'm at
in this interface at all times.

9a984532-d4bb-4f8a-864e-e79f810d0fdb-0
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.800
One of the first things that we sent
focus to here was called the skip link.

9e95d6e5-fbb8-48bf-a12b-4fbb20ebb2e7-0
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.505
We want to see those too when interfaces
have large chunks of content that should

9e95d6e5-fbb8-48bf-a12b-4fbb20ebb2e7-1
00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:46.440
be skipped over by keyboard users.

16fbe8a8-e2a0-44c2-8dc3-d592c4766281-0
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.773
In this case,
I can activate this Skip to site map link

16fbe8a8-e2a0-44c2-8dc3-d592c4766281-1
00:00:49.773 --> 00:00:54.534
and jump all the way down to the bottom
of the page and navigate the content in

16fbe8a8-e2a0-44c2-8dc3-d592c4766281-2
00:00:54.534 --> 00:00:58.880
the footer without having to tab through
all of the content in the page.

8c1d8ace-0e10-4991-b4b7-a2f9975fdf87-0
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.240
That's very helpful.

6c9d0d50-dac3-40bb-96d9-fb6182f7449f-0
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.396
And as I tab around,
I'm able to move through the experience

6c9d0d50-dac3-40bb-96d9-fb6182f7449f-1
00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:06.760
because my keyboard focus is not trapped.

032c9148-03d1-47a5-b925-8929fe76dae1-0
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.960
That's important too.

95db55dc-ff9d-4429-b932-6e5316fccfb2-0
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.080
We never want to be trapped in one spot.

13bd5115-0962-4225-8838-ff7147cd15a8-0
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.156
As we tab around the interface, we also,
while we're doing keyboard testing,

13bd5115-0962-4225-8838-ff7147cd15a8-1
00:01:17.156 --> 00:01:24.005
why not identify all functionality that
is present for mouse users or users of

13bd5115-0962-4225-8838-ff7147cd15a8-2
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:25.999
other pointing devices?

2e0daba2-20ee-4f30-a6bb-05882450063c-0
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.960
But those are there for keyboard users
too.

dece0b57-b679-49c4-b9b5-f199a7f006c1-0
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.560
So let's take a look at the Click here
button in the hero.

bea2f5cc-60f0-49c8-9f02-bcb42d607af9-0
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.668
If I click that,
the page scrolls down to this form down

bea2f5cc-60f0-49c8-9f02-bcb42d607af9-1
00:01:36.668 --> 00:01:38.360
at the bottom of the page.

687b6a4c-a4aa-46d8-99b2-55fbf37e63ea-0
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.725
So I would imagine if I tab to it and
then hit enter that that functionality

687b6a4c-a4aa-46d8-99b2-55fbf37e63ea-1
00:01:46.725 --> 00:01:48.440
would be present.

a2197989-d680-42a7-8c31-0bbaed050ced-0
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.280
So let's try that.

ed084b8e-4899-4912-9abc-47fb774e9989-0
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.774
I'm going to tab through the navigation
and we would imagine that the next thing

ed084b8e-4899-4912-9abc-47fb774e9989-1
00:01:53.774 --> 00:01:57.880
that I would tab to is the next focusable
element, the click here button.

92ad3cc3-bdd9-45a4-86b7-f17a804b3564-0
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.177
And as I tab there,
I actually skip all the way down to the

92ad3cc3-bdd9-45a4-86b7-f17a804b3564-1
00:02:01.177 --> 00:02:01.520
footer.

22d35d85-b15a-4ffb-98b4-d9ed34dbf2df-0
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.800
Something's going on here.

e716fb6a-e567-4c48-80b4-7ec9f9cc9cc7-0
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.520
Why isn't this link keyboard accessible?

0e3adc05-9003-415d-92ef-ce7f42ddd7f0-0
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.440
So at this point I would dive into the
code and figure out why this isn't

0e3adc05-9003-415d-92ef-ce7f42ddd7f0-1
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.640
keyboard accessible.

c0e8f915-6dc7-4e7a-bf38-dd1972e420f1-0
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.455
Another important consideration while
doing keyboard testing is when we send

c0e8f915-6dc7-4e7a-bf38-dd1972e420f1-1
00:02:20.455 --> 00:02:25.620
the keyboard focus to a focusable element
that it just doesn't automatically reload

c0e8f915-6dc7-4e7a-bf38-dd1972e420f1-2
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.880
the page or submit a web form without
warning users.
