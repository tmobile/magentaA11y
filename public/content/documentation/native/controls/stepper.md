How to test a stepper

1. Test keyboard only, then screen reader + keyboard actions

   - Tab, ctr+tab or arrow keys: Focus visibly moves to the button
   - Spacebar: Activates the button on iOS and Android
   - Enter: Activates the button on Android

2. Test mobile screenreader gestures

   - Swipe: Focus moves to the element, expresses its state, if applicable
   - Doubletap: Activates the button

3. Listen to screenreader output on all devices

   - Name: Purpose is clear (example: Increment or Increase, Decrement or Decrease)
   - Role: Identifies as a button in iOS and "double tap to activate" in Android
   - Value: Express the stepper value dynamically when it has visibly changed and when value is in focus
   - State: Expresses its state (disabled/dimmed)

4. Test device settings

   - Text resize: Text can resize up to 200% without losing information

### #a11y - Native Accessibility Acceptance Criteria

How to test a stepper

GIVEN THAT I am on a screen with a stepper

1. Scenario: Test keyboard actions

   - WHEN I press the "TAB" key, "CTRL+TAB" key, or an arrow key 
      - THEN the focus should visibly move to the button 
   - WHEN I press the "SPACEBAR" key 
      - THEN the button should be activated on iOS and Android 
   - WHEN I press the "ENTER" key 
      - THEN the button should be activated on Android

2. Scenario: Test mobile screen reader gestures

   - WHEN I swipe to navigate to the button 
      - THEN the focus should move to the button 
         - AND the button's state should be expressed if applicable 
   - WHEN I double-tap the button 
      - THEN the button should be activated 

3. Scenario: Test screen reader output on all devices

   - WHEN a screen reader reads the button 
      - THEN its name should clearly describe its purpose (e.g., "Increment," "Increase," "Decrement," or "Decrease") 
         - AND its role should be identified as "button" in iOS 
         - AND on Android, it should instruct "double tap to activate" 
         - AND its value should dynamically be expressed when the stepper value visibly changes and when the value is in focus 
         - AND its state (DISABLED or DIMMED) should be expressed if applicable 

4. Scenario: Test device OS settings for text resize

   - WHEN the text resize setting is increased up to 200% 
      - THEN the text within the stepper should remain readable without losing information or functionality

## iOS Developer Notes
### General Notes

   - A stepper is a two-segment control used to increase or decrease an incremental value
   - When new value changes, it gets announced dynamically without moving focus from the increment/decrement button
   - Announcing the label when appropriate with the value gives the screen reader users and users with memory challenges context

### Name

   - If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.
      - **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.

   - **UIKit**

      - You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.
         - The stepper's title will overwrite the segmentâ€™s `accessibilityLabel`.
      - To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`
      - To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.

   - **SwiftUI**

      - By default, the programmatic name is the visible text label of the segment
      - If necessary, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.
      - If a segment has icon(s), hide the icon(s) from VoiceOver by using view modifier `accessibilityHidden(true)`.

### Role

   - The presence of the stepper buttons implies an interactive stepper component.
   - The stepper buttons themselves should be announced as "Button".

   - **UIKit**

      - Use `UIStepper`

   - **SwiftUI**

      - Use native `Stepper` view

### Groupings

   - N/A

   - **UIKit**

      - Follow native grouping and order

   - **SwiftUI**

      - Follow native grouping and order

### State

   - The stepper button's state should be announced as "Increment" or "Decrement".
   - The new value should be announced when the user activates one of the buttons.

   - **UIKit**

      - For disabled stepper: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is "Dimmed".
         - If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the menu item to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the segmented control.

   - **SwiftUI**

      - For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`

### Focus

   - Use the device's default focus functionality. 
   - External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.

   - **UIKit**

      - If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`
         - **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.
      - To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.
      - To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.
      - `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements. 

   - **SwiftUI**

      - For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.
         - Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.
         - Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.
      - If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.

### Announcements

   - Increment
      - "Label with current value, Increment, Button"
      - If button is activated new value will dynamically announce
   - Decrement
      - "Label with current value, Decrement, Button"
      - If button is activated new value will dynamically announce

## Android Developer Notes
### General Notes

   - There is no native stepper element for Android. The notes below are suggestions and accessibility guidance.

### Developer notes 

   - A stepper is a two-segment control used to increase or decrease an incremental value
   - When new value changes, it gets announced dynamically without moving focus from the increment/decrement button
   - Announcing the label when appropriate with the value gives the screen reader users and users with memory challenges context

### Name

   - Name includes the purpose and describes the item changing, matching any visible label and references the number shown between stepper (if visible).
   - `android:text` XML attribute
   - Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name, depending on type of view and for elements without a visible label.
   - `contentDescription` overrides `android:text` 
   - Use `labelFor` attribute to connect the visible label to the control

### Role

   - Extend the most relevant View subclass as is relevant to this control
   - `Button` or `ImageButton`

### State

   - Active: `android:enabled=true`
   - Disabled: `android:enabled=false`. Announcement: "disabled"

### Focus

   - Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus. 
   - Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.
   - `android:focusable=true`
   - `android=clickable=true`
   - Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, not `onTouch( )`
   - `nextFocusDown`
   - `nextFocusUp`
   - `nextFocusRight`
   - `nextFocusLeft`
   - `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)
   - To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`
   - To NOT move focus, but announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`
   - To hide controls: `Important_For` `_Accessibility_NO`

### Announcements

   - Increment or Increase
      - "Label with value, Increment or Increase, Double tap to activate"
      - If button is activated new value will dynamically announce
   - Decrement or Decrease
      - "Label with value, Decrement or Decrease, Double tap to activate"
      - If button is activated new value will dynamically announce
