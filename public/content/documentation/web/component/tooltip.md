How to test a header

1. Test keyboard only, then screen reader + keyboard actions

   - Skip-links: Focus moves directly to the header or navigation

   - Tab: Nothing, headings are not focusable unless they are actionable

   - Arrow-keys: Headings are browsed

2. Test mobile screenreader gestures

   - Swipe: Focus moves directly to the header or navigation

   - Doubletap: This typically activates most elements

3. Listen to screenreader output on all devices

   - It is discoverable with screenreader shortcuts as header/banner landmark

   - Group: It typically contains the name and primary navigation of the website
